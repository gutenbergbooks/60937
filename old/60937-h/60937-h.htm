PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH.</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<small>OF RESPIRATION.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><a id="para_313"></a>313. No organized being can live without food
and no food can nourish without air. In all creatures
the necessity for air is more urgent than
that for food, for some can live days, and even
weeks, without a fresh supply of food, but none
without a constant renewal of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p><a id="para_314"></a>314. The food having undergone the requisite
preparation in the apparatus provided for its assimilation,
is brought into contact with the air, from
which it abstracts certain principles, and to which
it gives others in return. By this interchange of
principles the composition of the food is changed:
it acquires the qualities necessary for its combination
with the living body. The process by which
the air is brought into contact with the food, and
by which the food receives from the air the qualities
which fit it for becoming a constituent part
of the living body, constitutes the function of
respiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_315"></a>315. In the plant, the air and the food meet in
contact and re-act on each other in the leaf. The
crude food of the plant having in its ascent from
the root through the stalk, received successive
additions of organic substances, by which its nature
is assimilated to the chemical condition of the
proper nutritive fluid of the plant (320 and 325),
undergoes in the leaf a double process; that of
Digestion and that of Respiration. The upper
surface of the leaf is a digestive apparatus, analogous
to the stomach of the animal; the under
surface of the leaf is a respiratory apparatus, analogous
to the lung of the animal. For the performance
of this double function, incessantly
carried on by the leaf, its organization is admirably
adapted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CXXII"></a>Fig. CXXII.</div>

<p><a id="para_316"></a>316. The solid skeleton of the leaf consists of
a net-work composed partly of woody fibres and
partly of spiral vessels which proceed from the
stem, and which are called veins (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXII">CXXII</a>.</span> 1, 3).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
In the interstices between the veins is disposed a
quantity of cellular tissue, termed the parenchyma
of the leaf (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXII">CXXII</a>.</span> 4): the whole is enveloped
in a membrane, called the cuticle (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 1),
which is furnished with apertures denominated
stomata, or stomates (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIV">CXXIV</a>.</span>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CXXIII"></a>Fig. CXXIII.</div>

<blockquote>

cuticle filled with air; 2. double series of cylindrical cells

particles; 3. irregular cells forming a reticulated texture
occupying the under surface of the leaf; 4. interspaces between
the cells, termed the intercellular passages or air
chambers.</small></p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><a id="para_317"></a>317. The cuticle consists of a layer of minute
cellules, colourless, transparent, without vessels,
without organic particles of any kind, and probably
filled with air (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 1). These cel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>lules
open externally, at certain portions of the
cuticle, by apertures or passages which constitute
the stomates (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIV">CXXIV</a>.</span>), and which present the
appearance of areolæ with a slit in the centre
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIV">CXXIV</a>.</span>). They form a kind of oval sphincters,
which are capable of opening or shutting,
according to circumstances, and they are disposed
on both surfaces of the leaf, but most abundantly
on the under surface, excepting in leaves which
float on water, in which they are always on the
upper surface only.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CXXIV"></a>Fig. CXXIV.</div>
<img src="images/i_005.jpg"  alt="" />
<blockquote>
<p><small>View of the stomata of a leaf, some of them represented
as open and others as closed.</small></p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><a id="para_318"></a>318. The cellular tissue or parenchyma, immediately
beneath the cuticle, when examined in
thin slices, and viewed under a microscope with a
high magnifying power, presents a regular structure
disposed in perfect order. It consists, on the
upper surface, of a layer, and sometimes of two
and even three layers, of vesicles of an oblong or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
cylindrical form, placed perpendicularly to the
surface of the leaf, set close to each other (fig.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 2), and filled with organic particles constituting
the green matter which determines the
colour of the leaf. On the under surface, on
the contrary, the vesicles, which are larger than
the cylindrical, are of an irregular figure, and are
placed in an horizontal direction, at such distances
as to leave wide intervals between each
other (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 3); yet uniting and anastomosing
together, and thus forming a reticulated tissue,
presenting the appearance of a net with large
meshes (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 3).</p>

<p><a id="para_319"></a>319. A leaf, then, consists of a double congeries
of vesicles containing organic particles, penetrated
by woody fibre and air vessels (which is probably
the true nature of the spiral vessels), the whole
being enclosed within a hollow stratum of air-cells.</p>

<p><a id="para_320"></a>320. The crude sap, composed principally of
water, holding in solution carbonic acid, acetic
acid, sugar, and a matter analogous to gum, is
transmitted through the leaf-stalk to the cylindrical
vesicles of the upper surface of the leaf (fig.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 2). These vesicles exhale a large proportion
of the water; the evaporation of which is
so powerfully assisted by the action of the sun’s
rays, that it would probably become excessive,
were it not for the perpendicular direction of the
cylindrical vesicles (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 2); but in consequence
of their being disposed perpendicularly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
the surface of the leaf, their ends only are presented
towards the heavens (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 2), and
thus the main part of their surface is protected
from the direct influence of the solar rays. The
primary effect of the evaporation carried on in the
cylindrical vesicles, is the condensation of the
organic matters contained in the sap.</p>

<p><a id="para_321"></a>321. At the same time that the cylindrical vesicles
pour the superfluous water of the sap into
the surrounding atmosphere, they abstract from
the atmosphere in return carbonic acid, which, together
with that already contained in the sap, is
decomposed. The oxygen is evolved; the carbon
is retained. The physical agent by which this
chemical change, which constitutes the digestive
process of the plant, is effected, is the solar ray;
hence the vesicles which contain the fluid to be
decomposed, are placed on the upper surface of
the leaf, where their contents are fully exposed to
the action of the sun; and hence also this process
takes place only during the day, and most powerfully
under the direct solar ray: but although
the direct influence of the sun be highly conducive
to the process, yet it is not indispensable to it;
for it goes on in daylight although there be no
sunshine. Light, then, would appear to be the
physical agent which effects on the crude food of
the plant a change analogous to that produced on
the crude food of the animal by the juices of the
stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p><a id="para_322"></a>322. After the sap has been elaborated in the
cylindrical vesicles, by the exhalation of its watery
particles, by the condensation of its organic matter,
by the retention of carbon and the evolution
of oxygen, it is transmitted to the reticulated vesicles
of the under surface of the leaf (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 3),
These vesicles, large, loose, and expanded, as they
have an opposite function to perform, are arranged
in a mode the very reverse of the cylindrical:
in such a manner as to present the greatest
possible extent of surface to the surrounding
air (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 3): at the same time the broad
interspaces between them (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 4) are so
many cavernous air-chambers into which the air is
admitted through the stomates (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIV">CXXIV</a>.</span>). The
cylindrical vesicles, exposed to the direct rays of
the sun, are protected by the closeness with which
they are packed; and by the small extent of surface
they present to the heavens: the reticulated
vesicles, whose function requires that they should
have the freest possible exposure to the surrounding
air, are protected from the solar ray, first by
their position on the under surface of the leaf; and,
secondly, by the dense and thick barrier formed by
the stratum of cylindrical vesicles (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIII">CXXIII</a>.</span> 2).</p>

<p><a id="para_323"></a>323. In the cylindrical vesicles carbonic acid is
decomposed; in the reticulated vesicles, on the
contrary, carbonic acid is re-formed. The oxygen
required for this generation of carbonic acid is
abstracted partly from the surrounding air; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
carbon is derived partly, perhaps, from the air,
but chiefly from the digested sap, and the carbonic
acid, formed by the union of these elements,
is evolved into the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p><a id="para_324"></a>324. This operation, which is strictly analogous
to that of respiration in the animal, in which
carbonic acid is always generated and expired, is
carried on chiefly in the night. In this manner,
under the influence of the solar light, the leaf decomposes
carbonic acid; retains the carbon and
returns the greater part of the oxygen to the air in
a gaseous form. At night, in the absence of the
solar ray, the leaf absorbs oxygen, combines this
oxygen with the materials of the sap to produce
carbonic acid, which, as soon as formed, is evolved
into the surrounding air. The carbonic acid gas
exhaled during the night is re-absorbed during
the day and oxygen is evolved; and this alternate
action goes on without ceasing; whence the plant
deteriorates the air by night, by the abstraction of
its oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid;
and purifies it by day by the evolution of oxygen
and the abstraction of carbonic acid.</p>

<p><a id="para_325"></a>325. The result of these chemical actions is the
conversion of the crude sap into the proper nutritive
juice of the plant. When it reaches the
cylindrical vesicles, the sap is colourless, not coagulable,
without globules, composed chiefly of
water holding in solution carbonic and acetic
acids, sugar, gum, and several salts; when it leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the reticulated vesicles it is a greenish fluid, partly
coagulable and abounding with organic particles
under the form of globules. Its chemical composition
is now wholly changed; it consists of resinous
matter, starch, gluten, and vegetable albumen.
It is now thoroughly elaborated nutritive fluid;
the proper food of the plant (cambium); rich in
all the principles which are fitted to form vegetable
secretions: it is to the plant what arterial
blood is to the animal, and like the vital fluid
formed in the lung, the cambium elaborated in
the leaf, is transmitted to the different parts and
organs of the plant to serve for their nutrition and
development.</p>

<p><a id="para_326"></a>326. The formation of this nutritive fluid by
the plant is a vital process, as necessary to the
continuance of its existence, as the process of sanguification
is necessary to the maintenance of the
life of the animal. If the plant be deprived of its
leaves, if the cold destroy, or the insect devour
them, the nutrition of the plant is arrested; the
development of the flowers, the maturation of the
fruit, the fecundation of the seeds, all are stopped
at once, and the plant itself perishes.</p>

<p><a id="para_327"></a>327. The proper nutritive juice of the plant,
completed by the process of respiration, is formed
by the elaboration of organic combinations of a
higher nature than those afforded by the sap.
Acid, sugar, gum (<a href="#para_325">325</a>) are converted into the
higher organic compounds, resin, gluten, starch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
albumen, probably by chemical processes, the result
of which is the inversion of the relative proportions
of oxygen and carbon. In the organic
matters contained in the sap, the proportion of
oxygen, compared with that of carbon, is in excess;
on the contrary, in the higher compounds
contained in the cambium, the carbon preponderates:
by the inversion of the relative proportions
of these two elements, the organic compounds of
a lower nature, appear to be changed into those of
a higher; to be brought into a chemical condition
nearer to that of the proper substance of the plant;
a condition in which they receive the last degree
of elaboration preparatory to their conversion into
that substance.</p>

<p><a id="para_328"></a>328. In the process of respiration in the animal,
as in the plant, parts of the digested aliment
mix with the air; parts of the air mix with the
digested aliment; and by this interchange of principles,
the chemical composition of the aliment
acquires the closest affinity to that of the animal
body; is rendered fit to combine with it; fit to
become a constituent part of it.</p>

<p><a id="para_329"></a>329. The extent and complexity of the respiratory
apparatus in the animal, is in the direct ratio
of the elevation of its structure and the activity of
its function, to which the quantity of air consumed
by it is always strictly proportionate.</p>

<p><a id="para_330"></a>330. The process of respiration in the animal
is effected by two media, air and water; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
only real agent is the air; for the water contributes
to the function only by the air contained in
it. Respiration by water is termed aquatic, that
by the atmosphere, atmospheric or aërial respiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_331"></a>331. The quantity of air contained in water
being small, aquatic is proportionally less energetic
than aërial respiration; and, accordingly,
the creatures placed at the bottom of the animal
scale, having the simplest structure and the narrowest
range of function, are all aquatic.</p>

<p><a id="para_332"></a>332. Whatever the medium breathed, respiration
in the animal is energetic in proportion to
the extent of the respiratory surface exposed to
the surrounding element. As the water-breathing
animals successively rise in organization, their
respiratory surface becomes more and more extended,
and a proportionally larger quantity of
water is made to flow over it. It is the same in
aërial respiration: the higher the animal, the
greater the extent of its respiratory surface; and
the larger the bulk of air that acts upon it.</p>

<p><a id="para_333"></a>333. Whatever the medium breathed, respiration
is effected by the contact of fresh strata of
the surrounding element with the respiratory surface.
The mode in which this constant renewal
of the strata is effected, is either by the motion of
the body to and fro in the element; or by the
creation of currents in it, which flow to the respiratory
surface. A main part of the apparatus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
respiration consists of the expedients necessary to
accomplish these two objects; and that apparatus
is simple, or complex, chiefly according to the extent
of the mechanism requisite to effect them.</p>

<p><a id="para_334"></a>334. Whatever the medium breathed, the organic
tissue which constitutes the essential part of
the immediate organ of respiration is the skin.
The primary tissue of which the skin is composed
is the cellular (23 et seq.), which, organized into
mucous membrane (33 et seq.), forms the essential
constituent of the skin (34). In all animals
the skin covers both the external and the internal
surfaces of the body (34). When forming the
external envelop, this organ commonly retains the
name of skin; when forming the internal lining,
it is generally called mucous membrane; and in
all animals, from the monad to man, either in the
form of an external envelop, or an internal lining,
or by both in conjunction, or by some localization
and modification of both, the skin constitutes the
immediate organ of respiration. In different
classes of animals it is variously arranged, assumes
various forms, and is placed in various situations,
according to the medium breathed, and the facility
of bringing its entire surface into contact with the
surrounding element; but in all, the organ and its
office are the same: it is the modification only—that
modification being invariably and strictly
adaptation, which constitutes the whole diversity
of the immediate organ of respiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p><a id="para_335"></a>335. At the commencement of the animal scale,
in the countless tribes of the polygastrica (vol. i.
p. 34, et seq.), respiration is effected through the
delicate membrane which envelops the soft substance
of which their body is composed. The air
contained in the water in which they live, penetrating
the porous external envelop, permeates
every part of their body; aërates their nutritive
juices; and converts them immediately into the
very substance of their body. They are not yet
covered with solid shells, nor with dense impervious
scales, nor with any hard material which
would exclude the general respiratory influence of
water, or render necessary any special expedient
to bring their respiratory surface into contact with
the element.</p>

<p><a id="para_336"></a>336. But in some tribes even of these simple
creatures there is visible by the microscope an
afflux of their nutritive juices to the delicate pellicle
that envelops them, in the form of a vascular
net-work, in which there appears to be a motion
of fluids, probably the nutritive juices flowing in
the only position of the body in which they could
come into direct contact with the surrounding
element. In some more highly advanced tribes,
as in wheel animalcules, there is an obvious circulating
system in vessels near the surface of the
skin. In other tribes, the internal surface constituting
the alimentary canal, is of great extent
and width, and forms numerous cavities which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
are often distended with water. In this manner
a portion of the internal, as well as the external
surface is made contributary to the function of
respiration, and this extended respiration is conducive
to their great and continued activity, to
their rapid development, and to the extraordinary
fertility of their races.</p>

<p><a id="para_337"></a>337. In creatures somewhat higher in the scale,
a portion of the external surface is reflected inwards
in the form of a sac, with an external opening
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 1). In some medusæ there are
numerous sacs of this kind, which pass inwards
until they are separated only by thin septa from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the cavities of the stomach. The water permeating
and filling these sacs comes into contact with
an interior portion of the body, not to be reached
through the external surface. At the margin of
the disk (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 6) there is spread out a delicate
net-work of vessels (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 5); these vessels
communicate with small canals (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 4)
which open into larger canals (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 3) that
proceed directly from the stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXV">CXXV</a>.</span> 2).
As the aliment is prepared by the stomach, it is
transmitted thence by these communicating canals
to the exterior net-work of vessels where it is
aërated.</p>

<p><a id="para_338"></a>338. As organization advances, as the component
tissues of the body become more dense, and
are moulded into more complex structures, when,
moreover, these structures are placed deep in the
interior of the body, far from the external envelop,
and proportionally distant from the surrounding
element, the respiratory apparatus necessarily increases
in complexity. The first complication
consists in the formation of minute, delicate, transparent
tubes (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVI">CXXVI</a>.</span> 5), which communicate
with the external surface by a special organ (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase">CXXVI.</span> 4) that conveys water into the interior of
the body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVI">CXXVI</a>.</span> 5). By means of these ramifying
water-tubes, upon the delicate walls of
which the blood-vessels are spread out in minute
and beautiful capillaries, the water is brought into
immediate contact with the vascular system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p><a id="para_339"></a>339. Next, in the ascending scale, the external
envelop of the body is extended into a distinct
additional or supplemental organ, by which the
function of the skin is assisted. This additional
organ is called branchia or gill. The simplest
form of branchia consists of folds or duplicatures
of skin, forming ramified tufts (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVII">CXXVII</a>.</span> 1),
which in general have a regular and often a symmetrical
disposition on the external surface (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVII">CXXVII</a>. </span> 1). Sometimes, as in the water breathing
annelides, these tufts form a fan-like expansion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
around the head; but at other times they
are disposed in regular series along the whole
extent of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>
<p><a id="para_340"></a>340. Instead of branchiæ in the form of ramified
tufts, the ascending series of animals, namely,
the higher crustacea, possess branchiæ composed
of numerous, delicate, thin laminæ or leaves,
divided from each other, yet placed in close proximity,
like the teeth of a fine comb, whence this
arrangement is termed pectinated. Over the
blood-vessels of the system spread out on these
delicate, fringed, pectinated leaves, the water is
driven in constant streams.</p>

<p><a id="para_341"></a>341. Still higher in the scale, as in molluscous
animals, an internal sac is formed to which are
sometimes attached numerous tufts; but which
at other times is itself plaited into beautifully disposed
regular folds, crowded with blood-vessels
and constantly bathed with fresh currents of
water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>Trichoda showing the form and a frequent arrangement

<p><a id="para_342"></a>342. In all these water-breathing creatures,
respiration is effected, either by the progressive
motion of the body through the water, or by the
creation of currents which bring fresh strata of
the fluid into contact with the respiratory surfaces.
Both objects are effected by the same in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>struments,
namely, minute fibres having the appearance
of fine hairs or bristles. These fibres
which are called cilia, have in general an elongated,
flattened, thin, and tapering form (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVIII">CXXVIII</a>. </span>). Their number, position, and arrangement,
are infinitely various. Sometimes, as in the
poriferous animals, they are so minute that they
cannot be rendered visible to the eye even by the
microscope, although the evidence of their existence
and action is indubitable. Sometimes they
are of great size and strength, attached by distinct
ligaments to the body and moved by powerful
muscles, as in wheel animalcules. Sometimes,
as in polypiferous animals, they are disposed
around the orifice of the polypes or upon the sides
of the tentacula, the instruments by which the
animal seizes its prey. Sometimes they are symmetrically
disposed in longitudinal series along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
surface of the body, as in the Beroe pileus; at
other times they are arranged in circles; whenever
there are branchiæ, they are disposed around the
margin of the branchial apertures, and always
on the margins of the minute meshes which compose
the branchiæ themselves.</p>

<p><a id="para_343"></a>343. In some cases the number of these cilia is
immense. Each polype, for example, has usually
twenty-two tentacula, and there are about fifty
cilia on each side of a tentaculum, making two
thousand two hundred cilia on each polype. As
there are about one thousand eight hundred cells
in each square inch of surface, and the branches
of an ordinary specimen present about ten square
inches of surface, we may estimate that an ordinary
specimen of this zoophite presents more
than eighteen thousand polypes, three hundred
and ninety-six thousand tentacula, and thirty-nine
million six hundred thousand cilia. But
other species contain more than ten times these
numbers. Dr. Grant has calculated that there
are about four hundred million cilia on a single
Flustra foliacea.</p>

<p><a id="para_344"></a>344. The motions of these cilia are regular,
incessant, and when in full activity far too rapid
to be distinguished by the eye even when assisted
by the microscope. They are generally to be perceived
only when their motions are comparatively
feeble. They produce two effects. In animals
capable of progressive motion, they transport the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
body through the water, while they constantly
bring new strata of water into contact with the
respiratory surface. In this case they are partly
organs of locomotion, and partly organs subservient
to respiration. On the other hand, in animals
which are not capable of moving from place to
place, they create currents by which the respiratory
surface is constantly bathed with fresh
streams of water. These currents are regular,
constant, unceasing. Like some physical phenomena
not depending on vitality, it is a continued
stream as regular as the motions of rivers from
their source to the ocean, or any other movements
depending on the established order of
things. Dr. Grant, to whom we are indebted for
our knowledge of the true nature of these currents,
as well as of the instruments by which
they are effected, gives the following account of the
observation which led to the discovery:—“I put,”
says he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> “a small branch of the spongia coalita,
with some sea water into a watch-glass, under the
microscope, and on reflecting the light of a candle
through the fluid, I soon perceived that there was
some intestine motion in the opaque particles floating
through the water. On moving the watch-glass,
so as to bring one of the apertures on the side
of the sponge fully into view, I beheld, for the first
time, the splendid spectacle of this living fountain,
vomiting forth from a circular cavity an impetuous
torrent of liquid matter, and hurling
along in rapid succession opaque masses which it
strewed everywhere around. The beauty and
novelty of such a scene in the animal kingdom
long arrested my attention, but after twenty-five
minutes of constant observation, I was obliged to
withdraw my eye from fatigue, without having
seen the torrent for one instant change its direction,
or diminish in the slightest degree the
rapidity of its course. I continued to watch the
same orifice, at short intervals, for five hours,
sometimes observing it for a quarter of an hour at
a time, but still the stream rolled on with a constant
and equal velocity.”</p>

<p><a id="para_345"></a>345. The simple expedients which have been
described suffice for carrying on the function of
respiration in the water-breathing invertebrata;
but in creatures that possess a vertebral column,
and the more perfect skeleton of which it forms a
part, there is a prodigious advancement in the
organization of the whole body, of the nervous
and muscular systems especially, the organs of
the animal, as well as in all the organs of the
organic life. A corresponding development of
the function of respiration is indispensable. Accordingly,
a sudden and great development in the
apparatus of this function is strikingly apparent
in fishes, the lowest order of the vertebrata, in
which the branchiæ, though still preserving the
same form as in the animals below them, are large
and complex organs. The branchiæ of fishes still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
consist of fringed folds of membrane disposed, as
in the preceding classes, in laminæ or leaves (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>. </span> 5); but there are now commonly four series
of these leaves, on each side of the body, placed
in close approximation to each other, the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
leaves being divided into minute fibres, which are
set close like the barbs of a feather, or the teeth
of a fine comb (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 5). Each leaf rests
either on a cartilaginous or a bony arch, which
exactly resembles the rib of the more perfect skeleton,
and performs a strictly analogous function;
for these arches are capable of alternately separating
from, and of approximating to, each other,
and these alternate motions are effected by appropriate
muscles. As these movements of separation
or approximation take place, the branchiæ
are either opened or closed, and their surface proportionally
expanded or contracted. Upon these
leaves (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 5) the veins (<a href="#para_347">347</a>) of the system
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 4) are spread out in a state of capillary
division of extreme minuteness, forming a
net-work of vessels of extreme tenuity and delicacy.
So prodigiously is the surface increased for
the expansion of these vessels by the leaf-like disposition
of the branchiæ, that it is computed that
the branchial surface of the skate is at least equal
to the surface of the whole human body.</p>

<p><a id="para_346"></a>346. Through this extended surface the whole
blood of the system must circulate, and every
point of it must be unceasingly bathed with fresh
streams of water. To generate the force necessary
for the accomplishment of these objects, an
increase of power must be communicated both to
the circulating and to the respiratory apparatus.
Neither the contractile power of the vessels by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
which in some of the simpler animals the nutritive
fluid is put in motion, nor the contraction of
the rudimentary heart by which in creatures somewhat
higher in the scale a more decided impulse
is given to the blood, are sufficient. A muscular
heart, capable of acting with great power, is now
constructed, which is placed in such a position as
to enable it to propel with velocity the whole blood
of the body through the myriads of capillary vessels
that crowd every point of the surface of the
branchial leaflets. To bring the water with
the requisite degree of force into contact with
this flowing stream, the apparatus of cilia is
wholly inadequate. The water entering by the
mouth, is driven with force, by the powerful muscles
of the thorax, through apertures that lead to
the branchial cavities. At the instant that the
branchial leaves receive the currents of water
through the appropriate apertures, the cartilaginous
or bony arches which sustain the leaves,
separate to some distance from each other, and to
that extent expand the leaves and proportionally
increase the surface exposed to the water: at the
same time, the rush of water through the leaves
unfolds and separates each of the thousand minute
filaments of which they are composed, so
that they all receive the full action of the fluid as
it flows over them.</p>

<p><a id="para_347"></a>347. After the venous blood of the system has
been thus exposed to the action of the respiratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
medium, it is taken up by the vessels called the
branchial veins (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 6), which for the
reason assigned (<a href="#para_372">372</a>) are functionally arteries,
as the branchial artery (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 4) is functionally
a vein. The branchial veins uniting together
form the great arterial trunk of the system,
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXIX">CXXIX</a>.</span> 7) by which the aërated blood is carried
out to every part of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_348"></a>348. But as if even this extent of apparatus
were insufficient to afford the amount of respiration
required by the system of the fish, the entire
surface of its body, which in general is naked and
highly vascular, respires like the branchiæ. Moreover,
many fishes swallow large draughts of air,
by which they aërate the mucous surface of their
alimentary canal, which also is highly vascular;
and still further, numerous tribes of these animals
are provided with a distinct additional organ, a
bag placed along the middle of the back filled
with air. Commonly this air bag communicates
with some part of the alimentary canal near the
stomach, by means of a short wide canal termed
the ductus pneumaticus, but sometimes it forms a
simple shut sac without any manifest opening;
at other times it is divided and subdivided in a
perfectly regular manner, forming extended ramified
tubes; while at other times its ramifications
present the appearance of so many pulmonary
cells. It is the rudiment of the complex lung of
the higher vertebrata, and it assists respiration;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
although since in some tribes it contains not atmospheric
air but azote, it is without doubt subservient
to other uses in the economy of the animal.</p>

<p><a id="para_349"></a>349. In water-breathing animals, from the lowest
to the highest, it is then manifest that a special
apparatus is provided for, constantly renewing the
streams of water that are brought into contact
with their respiratory surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

the alimentary canal.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_350"></a>350. It is the same in aërial respiration. In
the simplest form of aërial respiration the apparatus
consists of minute bags or sacs, placed commonly
in pairs along the back, which open for
the admission of the air on the external surface,
by small orifices called spiracula or spiracles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>.</span> 2), at the sides of the body. In the
common earth-worm there are no less than one
hundred and twenty of these minute air vesicles,
each of which is provided with an external opening
placed between the segments of the body. In
the leech, the number is reduced to sixteen on
each side, which open externally by the same
number of minute orifices. Over the internal
surface of these air vesicles the blood of the
system is distributed in minute and delicate capillaries;
and is capable of being aërated by
whichever medium may pass through the external
orifices, whether water or air.</p>

<p><a id="para_351"></a>351. In this simple apparatus is apparent the
rudiment of the more perfect aërial respiration by
the organs termed tracheæ, minute air tubes which
ramify like blood-vessels through the body (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>. </span> 3). These air tubes open on the external
surface by distinct apertures termed <em>spiracula</em>
or <em>spiracles</em> (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>.</span> 2), which are commonly
placed in rows on each side of the body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>.</span>
2), with distinct prominent edges (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>.</span> 2),
often surrounded with hairs; sometimes guarded
by valves to prevent the entrance of extraneous
bodies, and capable of being opened and closed by
muscles specially provided for that purpose. These
tubes, as they proceed from the spiracles to be distributed
to the different organs of the body, often
present the appearance of radii (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXX">CXXX</a>.</span> 3),
and when traced to their terminations are found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
to end in vesicles of various sizes and figures, but
commonly of an elongated and oblong form. These
minute vesicles, when examined by the microscope,
are seen to afford still minuter ramifications, which
are ultimately lost in the tissues of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_352"></a>352. The tracheæ are composed of three tunics,
the external dense, white and shining; the
internal soft and mucous, between which is placed
a middle tunic, dense, firm, elastic, and coiled into
a spiral. By this arrangement the tube is constantly
kept in a state of expansion, and is therefore
always open to the access of air. A great
part of the blood of the body, in the extensive
class of creatures provided with this form of respiratory
apparatus, including the almost countless
tribes of insects, is not contained in distinct
vessels, but is diffused by transudation through the
several organs and tissues of the body. All the
creatures of this class live in air, and possess great
activity; they therefore require a high degree of
respiration; yet they are commonly small in size,
and often some portions of their body consist of
exceedingly dense and firm textures; hence to
have localized the function of respiration, by
placing the seat of it in a single organ, would
have been impossible, on account of the disproportionate
magnitude which such an organ must
have possessed; in this case it was easier to carry
the air to the blood, than the blood to the air, and
accordingly the air is carried to the blood, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
like the blood in creatures of higher organization,
is diffused through every part of the system.</p>

<p><a id="para_353"></a>353. The next advancement in the ascending
scale is, by a step which obviously connects this
higher class with the classes below and above it.
It consists of distinct cells, termed pulmonic cavities
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXI">CXXXI</a>.</span> 4), which communicate externally
by spiracula (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXI">CXXXI</a>.</span> 1), like tracheæ (<a href="#para_351">351</a>),
but which are lined internally by a soft and delicate
membrane plaited into folds, disposed like the
teeth of a comb (pectinated) (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXI">CXXXI</a>.</span> <i>a</i>), presenting
a striking analogy to the structure of gills
(<a href="#para_345">345</a>), and therefore called by the French writers
pneumo-branchiæ. These cavities have the internal
form of an aquatic organ, but they perform
the function of air-breathing sacs. In scorpions
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXI">CXXXI</a>.</span> 1) and spiders, this form of the apparatus
is seen in its simplest condition; in the
slug and snail it is more highly developed: for in
these latter animals a rounded aperture, placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
near the head, and guarded by a sphincter muscle,
that alternately dilates and contracts, leads to a
single cavity, which is lined with a membrane
delicately folded, and overspread with a beautiful
net-work of pulmonary blood-vessels.</p>

<p><a id="para_354"></a>354. Passing from this to the lowest order of
the air-breathing vertebrata (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXII">CXXXII</a>.</span>), the
apparatus is perfectly analogous, but more developed.
In the reptile, this air-breathing sac,
which now constitutes a true and proper lung,
instead of being simple and undivided, is formed
by numerous septa, which traverse each other in
all directions, into vesicles or cells (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXII">CXXXII</a>.</span> 2),
which proportionally enlarge the surface for the
distribution of blood-vessels. In the Batrachian
reptile, as the frog, salamander, newt, &amp;c. (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXII">CXXXII</a>. </span>), the vesicles, comparatively few in number,
are of large size, and as thin and delicate
as soap-bubbles. In the ophidian reptile, as the
serpent, the sac is large and elongated, but divided
only in the upper and back part into vesicles;
while in the Saurian reptiles, as the crocodile,
lizard, chamelion, &amp;c., the sac is comparatively
small, but subdivided into very minute vesicles,
bearing a close analogy to the more perfectly organized
lung of the higher animals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>
<p><a id="para_355"></a>355. In birds, the next order of vertebrata (fig.
<span class="smcap">CXXXIII.</span>), as in insects, the class of invertebrated
animals which are formed for flight (<a href="#para_352">352</a>), the
respiratory organs extend through the greater part
of the body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>.</span> 4). The lungs (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>. </span> 2), which still consist of a single pulmonic
sac on each side (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>.</span> 2), are
divided into cells, minute compared with those of
the reptile, yet large compared with those of the
quadruped; at the same time numerous air sacs,
similar in structure to those of the lungs, but
of larger size, are distributed over different parts of
the body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>.</span> 4), which communicate with
the air cells of the lungs (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>.</span> 3); while
of these larger sacs, several communicate also with
the bones (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIII">CXXXIII</a>.</span> 6), so as to fill with air
those cavities which in other animals are occupied
with marrow.</p>

<p><a id="para_356"></a>356. In the mammalia, the highest order of the
vertebrata, respiration is less extended through the
system, and is concentrated in a single organ, the
lung, which, though comparatively smaller in bulk
than in some of the lower classes, is far more developed
in structure. The lung in this class consists
of a membranous bag, divided into an immense
number of distinct vesicles or cells, in the
closest possible proximity with each other, yet not
communicating, and presenting, from their minuteness,
a vast extent of internal surface. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
bag is confined to a distinct cavity of the trunk,
the thorax (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span>), completely separated
from the abdomen by the muscular partition, the
diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 10). This organ no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
longer sends down cells into the abdomen, nor
membranous tubes into the bones; but is concentrated
within the thorax along with the heart
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 2, 3, 8). In all the orders of this
class, the development and concentration of the
organ are in strict proportion to the perfection of
the general organization.</p>

<p><a id="para_357"></a>357. In man there are two pulmonary bags (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 2, 3), of nearly equal size, which, together
with the heart, completely fill the large cavity
of the thorax (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span>), their external surface
being everywhere in immediate contact with
the thoracic walls. One of these bags is placed on
the right side of the body, constituting the right
lung (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 2), and the other on the left,
constituting the left lung (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 3). Each
lung is divided by deep fissures, into large portions
called lobes (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 4, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>. </span>
6), of which there are three belonging to the
right, and two to the left lung. Each lobe is
subdivided into innumerable smaller parts termed
lobules (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 6, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>. </span> 6), while the
lobules successively diminish in size until they
terminate in minute vesicles that constitute the
great bulk of the organ (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span> 8).</p>

<p><a id="para_358"></a>358. The complete centralization of the respiratory
function which thus takes place in man,
renders the apparatus exceedingly complex both
on account of the expedients which are necessary
to obtain the requisite extent of surface, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
small allotted space, and to bring into contact
within that space the fluids that are to act on
each other.</p>

<p><a id="para_359"></a>359. The apparatus consists of a vessel to carry
the air to the blood; a vessel to carry the blood
to the air; an organ in which the air and the
blood meet; and an organization by which both
fluids are put in motion. The vessel that carries
the air to the blood is the windpipe (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></span>
1, 2); the vessel that carries the blood to the air
is the pulmonary artery (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 7); the organ
in which the blood and the air meet is the lung
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span> 5); the organization which puts the
air in motion, is the structure of bones, cartilage
and muscles, called the thorax (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span>), and the engine that communicates motion
to the blood is the right ventricle of the heart
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 5).</p>

<p><a id="para_360"></a>360. The windpipe is a tube which extends
from the mouth and nostrils to the lung (figs.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span> 1, 9, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>. </span> 2, 5). It is attached to
the back part of the tongue (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII.</span> 2, 9),
and passes down the neck immediately before
the esophagus, or the tube which leads to the
stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 9, 12).</p>

<p><a id="para_361"></a>361. In the different parts of its course the
windpipe is differently constructed, performs different
offices, and receives different names according
to the diversity of its structure and function.
The first division of it is called the larynx (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>. </span> 1.), the second the trachea (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span>

<p><a id="para_362"></a>362. The first portion of the windpipe called
the larynx (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>. </span>), constitutes
the organ of the voice. It is situated at the upper
and fore part of the neck (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 7, 9), immediately
under the bone to which the root of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
tongue, called the os hyoides (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span> 6, and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>. </span> 1), is attached. The larynx forms a
very complex structure, and is composed of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
variety of cartilages, muscles, ligaments, membranes,
and mucous glands (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 2, 3, 4,
5). At its upper part is a narrow opening of a
triangular figure called the glottis (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>.</span>
6), by which air is admitted to and from the lung.
Immediately above this opening is placed the
cartilage, which obtains its name from its situation,
<em>epiglottis</em> (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 5), which is attached to
the root of the tongue (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 6, 7), and which
may be distinctly seen in the living body by pressing
down the tongue.</p>

<p><a id="para_363"></a>363. The Epiglottis is highly elastic, and is an
agent of no inconsiderable importance in respiration,
deglutition, and speaking. In respiration it
breaks the current of air which rushes to the lungs
through the mouth and nostrils, and prevents it
from flowing to the delicate air cells with too great
a degree of force. During the action of deglutition
the epiglottis is carried completely over the
glottis (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 6, 7, 8), partly because it is
necessarily forced backwards, when the tongue
passes backwards in delivering the food to the
pharynx (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 6, 7, 8, 10), partly because it is
carried backwards by certain minute muscles which
act directly upon it, and perhaps also partly in
consequence of its own peculiar irritability. The
moment the action of deglutition has been performed
the epiglottis springs from the aperture of
the glottis, partly by its own elasticity, and partly
by the return of the tongue to its former position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
During the act of speaking the column of air which
is expelled from the lung, which rushes through
the glottis, and which thus forms the voice, strikes
against the epiglottis, and the voice becomes thereby
in some degree modified.</p>

<p><a id="para_364"></a>364. The second portion of the windpipe termed
the trachea (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CXXXV.</span> 2), commences at the
under part of the larynx (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span> 1), and extends
as far as the third dorsal vertebra, opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to which it divides into two branches which
are termed the bronchi (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span> 3, 4, and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVII">CXXXVII</a>. </span>). One of these branches, called the
right bronchus, goes to the right lung; the other
branch, called the left bronchus, goes to the left
lung (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span> 3, 4).</p>

<p><a id="para_365"></a>365. The trachea of man, like the tracheæ of the
air-breathing insect (<a href="#para_351">351</a>), is composed of three
tissues. These tissues differ essentially from each
other in nature, and are widely different in form
and arrangement. They consist of membrane,
muscle, and cartilage.</p>

<p><a id="para_366"></a>366. The membranous portion of the human
trachea consists of three coats, the cellular (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVII">CXXXVII</a>. </span>), the ligamentous (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 8), and
the mucous (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 9). From the cellular
and ligamentous coats the tube receives its
strength, and in some degree its elasticity; and
the mucous coat constitutes the chief seat of the
respiratory function. Between the ligamentous
and mucous coats are placed two sets of muscular
fibres; the first, the external set, passes in a
circular direction around the tube; the second set,
placed immediately beneath the circular, is disposed
longitudinally, and collected into bundles.
The office of the circular fibres is to diminish the
calibre of the tube, and that of the longitudinal
is to diminish its length.</p>

<p><a id="para_367"></a>367. As the tracheæ of the insect are kept constantly
open for the free admission of air by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
middle membranous tunic, dense, firm, elastic, and
coiled into a spiral (<a href="#para_351">351</a>), so, for the accomplishment
of the same purpose, there are placed between
the membranous coats of the human trachea
delicate rings of the more highly organized substance,
cartilage (35). These cartilaginous rings
amount in the entire course of the tube to sixteen
or eighteen in number (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a></span>. 2); each cartilage
being about a line in breadth, and the fourth
of a line in thickness. They never form complete
circles, but only a large segment of a circle (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 7); the circle is incomplete behind (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXVI</a>.</span> 7, 9), because there the esophagus is in
direct contact with the trachea (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a></span>. 9, 12),
and instead of dense and firm cartilage, a soft and
yielding substance is placed in this situation, in
order that there may be no impediment to the free
dilatation of the esophagus during the passage of
the food.</p>

<p><a id="para_368"></a>368. The point at which the bronchi enter the
substance of the lung is called the root of the lung
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a></span>. 3, 4). As soon as the bronchi begin
to divide and ramify within the lung each cartilage,
instead of preserving its crescent shape, is
divided into two or three separate pieces, which
nevertheless are still so disposed as to keep the
tube open. With the progressive diminution in
the size of the bronchial branches, their cartilages
become less numerous, and are placed at greater
distances from each other, until at length as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
bronchi terminate in the vesicles, the cartilages
wholly disappear; and with the decreasing number
and size of the cartilages, the thickness of the
cellular, ligamentous, and muscular coats of the
bronchi also lessens, until at the points where the
cartilages disappear, the muscular and mucous
tunics, now reduced to a state of extreme tenuity,
alone remain. The essential constituent of the
air vesicles, then, is the mucous membrane; but
there is reason to suppose that the muscular
tunic is likewise continued over these vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="para_369"></a>369. It has been stated that the tracheæ of the
insect terminate in the different tissues of its body
by minute vesicles of an oblong form. The termination
of the bronchi in the human lung presents
a strikingly analogous appearance. Malpighi, who
with extraordinary talent and success devoted his
life to the investigation of the minute structures of
the various organs of the human body, represents
the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes as
terminating in minute vesicles of unequal size: and
Reisseissen, who has more recently resumed the
inquiry and examined this structure with extreme
care, agrees with Malpighi in stating that the
bronchial tubes at their terminal points expand
into minute, delicate, membranous vesicles of a
cylindrical and somewhat rounded figure (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>. </span> 2). The bronchial tubes do not divide
to any great degree of minuteness (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>.</span>
1), but terminate somewhat abruptly in the vesicles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>.</span> 2), which though minute are large
enough to be visible to the naked eye (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>. </span> 2). Viewed in connexion with the
bronchial tubes at their terminal points, the vesicles
present a clustered appearance, not unlike
clusters of currants attached to their stem (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>. </span> 2).</p>

<p><a id="para_370"></a>370. In the insect, for the reason assigned
(<a href="#para_351">351</a>), these vesicles are diffused over the system,
aërating every point of the body; in man they are
concentrated in the lung; yet by their minuteness,
and by the mode in which they are arranged, they
present in the small space occupied by this organ,
so extended a surface that Hales, representing the
size of each vesicle at the 100dth part of an inch
in diameter, estimates the amount of surface furnished
by them collectively at 20,000 square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
inches. Keil estimating the number of the vesicles
at 174,000,000, calculates the surface they
present, at 21,906 square inches. Leiberkuhn at
150 cubic feet; and, according to Monro, it is
thirty times the surface of the human body.</p>

carries the air to the blood, and such is the mode
of its distribution.</p>

<p>The vessel that conveys the blood to the air
is the pulmonary artery, the great vessel which
springs from the right ventricle of the heart (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 5).</p>

<p>The pulmonary artery soon after it issues
from the right ventricle of the heart divides into
two branches (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 7, 8, 9), one for each
lung (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 8, 9). Each branch of the pulmonary
artery as soon as it enters its corresponding
lung (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 9) divides and ramifies
through the organ in a manner precisely similar
to the bronchial tubes. Every branch of the
artery is in contact with a corresponding branch
of the bronchus (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 2), divides as it divides,
and accurately tracks its course throughout (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 2), until the ultimate divisions of the artery
at length reach the ultimate vesicles of the bronchus
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 2, 10), upon the delicate walls of
which the capillary arteries rest, expand, and
ramify, forming a net-work of vessels, so complex
that the anatomist who first observed it, named it

<p><a id="para_372"></a>372. The blood which has finished its circulation
through the system, returned by the great
systemic veins (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 12, 13), to the right side
of the heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 3), is driven by the right
ventricle (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 5), into the pulmonary artery
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 7); by the branches of which (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>. </span> 8, 9) it is distributed to the air vesicles
of the lungs: consequently the right heart of
man bears precisely the same relation to the
lungs, that the single heart of the fish bears to the
branchiæ; the former is a pulmonic, as the latter
is a branchial heart; one half of the double heart
of the more highly organized creature is employed
to circulate the venous blood of the system
through the lungs, as the whole of the single heart
of the less highly organized animal, is employed to
propel the blood through the branchiæ (<a href="#para_368">368</a>).
From the capillary branches of the pulmonary
artery in the Rete Mirabile (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 9), arises
another set of vessels termed the pulmonary veins
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 10), which receive the blood from the
venous vessels spread out on the air vesicles: for
the pulmonary artery is functionally a vein, since
it contains venous blood, though it is nominally an
artery because it carries blood from the heart (269);
and in like manner the pulmonary veins are func<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>tionally
arteries since they contain arterial blood,
though they are nominally veins because they
carry blood to the heart (272). The branches of
the pulmonary arteries are larger in size and
greater in number than those of the pulmonary
veins, the reverse of what is observed in any other
part of the body; because the pulmonary artery
contains the blood which is to be acted upon by
the air, while the pulmonary veins merely receive
the blood which has been acted upon by the air,
and the former ramifies more minutely than the
latter, in order that the air may act on a larger
surface of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_373"></a>373. In the Rete Mirabile the junction of the
air-vessel with the blood-vessel is accomplished.
The combination of these two sets of vessels constitutes
the lung; for the lung is composed of air-vessels
and blood-vessels united, and sustained by
cellular tissue, and inclosed in the thin but firm
membrane called the pleura (104 and 105).</p>

<p><a id="para_374"></a>374. Such is the arrangement of that part of
the respiratory apparatus which contains the fluids
that are to act on each other. The object of the
remaining portion of it is to produce the movements
which are necessary to bring the fluids into
contact. This is accomplished by the mechanism
and action of the thorax and diaphragm (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 10).</p>

<p><a id="para_375"></a>375. These organs, which invariably act in con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>cert,
are so constructed and disposed, that when in
action they give to the chest two alternate motions,
one that by which its capacity is enlarged; and
the other that by which it is diminished. These
alternate movements are called the motions of
respiration. The motion by which the capacity
of the chest is enlarged is termed the action of
inspiration, and that by which it is diminished the
action of expiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_376"></a>376. The action of inspiration, or that by which
the capacity of the chest is enlarged, is effected
by the combined movements of the thorax and
diaphragm; by the ascent of the thorax and by the
descent of the diaphragm.</p>

<p><a id="para_377"></a>377. The osseous portion of the thorax, which
has been fully described (69 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), consists of
the spinal column (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 1), the ribs with their
cartilages (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2, 3), and the sternum (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span> 4). The soft portion of the thorax consists of
muscles and membrane (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLII">CXLII</a>. </span>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVII">CXLVII</a>. </span>), together with the common integuments of
the body. The chief boundaries of the cavity of the
thorax before, behind, and at the sides, are osseous,
being formed before by the sternum and the cartilages
of the ribs (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 4, 3); behind by the
spinal column and the necks of the ribs (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span>
1, 2); and at the sides by the bodies of the ribs.
Below the boundary is muscular, being formed by
the diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 3).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p><a id="para_378"></a>378. Externally the thorax is convex and enveloped
by muscle and skin; internally it is concave
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 1), and lined by a continuation
of the same membrane which envelops the lungs,
the pleura (104). But that portion of the pleura
which lines the internal wall of the thorax is called
the costal pleura (pleura costalis), in contradistinction
to that which envelops the lungs, which is
termed the pulmonary pleura, or pleura pulmonalis
(104). By the costal pleura, a thin but
firm and strong membrane, smooth, polished, and
like all the membranes of its class (serous membrane
30, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), kept in a state of perpetual
moisture and suppleness, by a fluid secreted at its
surface, the movements of the thorax are facilitated,
at the same time that they are prevented
from injuring the delicate organs contained in it.</p>

<p><a id="para_379"></a>379. The moveable parts of the osseous portion
of the thorax are the ribs and sternum. The ribs,
though by one extremity tied with exceeding firmness
to the spinal column by ligaments specially
constructed, and admirably adapted for that purpose
(figs. <span class="smcap">LVI.</span> 1, and <span class="smcap">LVII.</span> 1), and though attached
at their other extremity by their cartilages
to the sternum (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LVIII.</span>), are capable of three
motions, an upward, an outward, and a downward
motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CXLI"></a>Fig. CXLI.—<i>View of the osseous portion of the Thorax.</i></div>

<blockquote>
<p><small>1. Spinal column. 2. Ribs. 3. Cartilages of ribs. 4.

<p><a id="para_380"></a>380. The ribs form a series of moveable arches,
the convexity of the arches being outwards, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the whole being disposed in an oblique direction
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2). The first rib springs from the ver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>tebral
column at nearly a right angle (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span>
2); the acuteness of this angle increases in succession
as the ribs descend from the first to the
last (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2); in this manner each rib is
inclined obliquely outwards and downwards, and
the obliquity thus given to the general direction of
the ribs augments progressively from above downwards
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2).</p>

<p><a id="para_381"></a>381. In consequence of this conformation and
arrangement of the ribs, every degree of motion
which is communicated to them, necessarily influences
the capacity of the space they enclose.
If they are moved upwards they must enlarge that
space at the sides, because the intervals between
each other will be increased (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2);
and from behind forwards, because the distance
between the spinal column and the sternum (the
sternum being protruded forwards with their cartilaginous
extremities) (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 3, 4), will be increased.
If, on the other hand, they are moved
downwards, the capacity of the thorax will be proportionally
diminished in every direction (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>View of the intercostal muscles which fill up the interspaces

layer of fibres, the external and the internal, which cross
or intersect each other.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_382"></a>382. One part of the action of inspiration consists,
then, of this ascent of the ribs. The ascent
of the ribs is effected by the contraction of a
double layer of muscles called the intercostal (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLII">CXLII</a>. </span>), placed in succession between each rib;
and which communicate this motion in the fol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>lowing
mode. The first rib is fixed; the second
rib is moveable, but less moveable than the third,
the third than the fourth, and so on through the
series: consequently the contraction of the intercostal
muscles (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLII">CXLII</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 2) must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
elevate the whole series, because the upper ribs
afford fixed points for the action of the muscles;
and so, when all these muscles contract together,
they necessarily pull the more moveable arches
upwards towards the more fixed (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 2).</p>

<p><a id="para_383"></a>383. But from the oblique direction of the ribs,
they cannot ascend without at the same time protruding
forwards their anterior extremities (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>. </span>). Those extremities being attached to the
sternum, which forms the anterior wall of the
thorax, they cannot be protruded forwards without
at the same time carrying the sternum forwards
with them (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span>). Thus, by this two-fold
motion of the ribs, an upward and consequently
an outward motion, the capacity of the thorax is
increased from behind forwards, that is, in its
small diameter.</p>

<p><a id="para_384"></a>384. Such is the part of the action, in inspiration,
performed by the motion of the ribs. The
remaining part of that action, by far the most
important, consists of the enlargement of the
capacity of the thorax from above downwards, or
in its long diameter. This is effected by the descent
of the diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span>).</p>

<p><a id="para_385"></a>385. The diaphragm is a circular muscle, forming
a complete but moveable partition between the
thorax and the abdomen (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 10, and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>. </span> 3). When not in action its upper surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
forms an arch (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>. </span> 4, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>. </span> 1), the
convexity of which is towards the thorax (figs.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>. </span> 4, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>. </span> 1), and reaches as high as
the fourth rib (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1); its under surface,
or that towards the abdomen, is concave (figs.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>. </span> 10, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>. </span> 1). Its central portion is
tendinous (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 4). This central tendinous
portion of the diaphragm, which is in apposition
with the heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 8), and firmly
attached to the pericardium (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 7), is
nearly if not quite immoveable: it is only the lateral
or muscular portions (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 4) that are capable
of motion. Its central portion is constructed
of dense and firm tendon, and is immoveable, primarily,
in order to afford one of the two fixed
points (the ribs affording the other fixed point),
essential to the action of the muscular fibres that
constitute its lateral or moveable portions; and
secondarily, in order to afford a support to the
heart, which rests upon this central tendon.
Thus, in consequence of this tendon being rendered
absolutely fixed, the motions of the diaphragm
are completely prevented from incommoding
the motions of the heart; the function of
respiration from interfering with the function of
the circulation.</p>

<p><a id="para_386"></a>386. During the action of inspiration the muscular
or lateral portions of the diaphragm contract
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 3); its muscular fibres shorten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
themselves, and are approximated towards the
central tendon (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIII">CXLIII</a>.</span> 2); the consequence
is that the whole muscle descends (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>.</span>
1); passes from the fourth to below the seventh
rib (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>.</span>), loses its arched form and presents
the appearance of an oblique plane (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>. </span>). At the same time the muscles of the
abdomen are protruded forwards (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>.</span> 2),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and the viscera contained in its cavity are pushed
downwards. The result of these movements is,
that the capacity of the thorax is enlarged by all
the space that intervenes between the fourth rib<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1), and the lowest point of the oblique

together with all that gained by the protrusion of
the walls of the abdomen and the descent of its

<p><a id="para_387"></a>387. By the action of the intercostal muscles,
then, the capacity of the thorax is enlarged at the
sides and from behind forward, or in its short
diameter; by the action of the diaphragm, the
capacity of the thorax is enlarged from above
downwards, or in its long diameter; by the combined
action of both, the capacity of the thorax is
enlarged in every direction, and thus the motion of
inspiration is completed.</p>

<p><a id="para_388"></a>388. Expiration, the respiratory motion which
alternates with that of inspiration, consists of the
diminution of the capacity of the thorax, which is
effected by the converse motions of the same organs;
that is, by the descent of the ribs and the ascent
of the diaphragm.</p>

<p><a id="para_389"></a>389. By the descent of the ribs, the capacity of
the thorax is diminished in its short diameter, because
by this motion, the oblique arches of the
ribs are approximated to each other and to the
spinal column, and the sternum is also approximated
to the spinal column. The descent of the
ribs is effected first by the elasticity of their cartilages
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLI">CXLI</a>.</span> 2). When the intercostal muscles
relax, the force which raised the ribs ceases to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
applied, and that moment the elasticity of the cartilages
comes into play, and carries the ribs down
wards. Secondly, by the contraction of the abdominal
muscles (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>. </span> 2, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 6, 7, 8),
the direct effect of which is to pull the ribs downwards
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>.</span> 6, 7, 8).</p>

<p><a id="para_390"></a>390. By the ascent of the diaphragm the capacity
of the thorax is diminished in its long
diameter (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1). When the diaphragm
ascends, it changes from the figure of an oblique
plane (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>.</span> 1), re-assumes its arched form
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1), and reaches as high as the fourth
rib (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1). At the same time the abdominal
muscles contract (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 2), and are carried
inwards towards the spinal column (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>. </span> 2). The result of these movements is, that
the capacity of the thorax is diminished by all the
space that intervenes between the lowest point of
the oblique plane formed by the diaphragm and
the fourth rib (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 1), and by all the abdominal
space lost by the contraction of the muscles
of the abdomen (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 2).

<p><a id="para_391"></a>391. The first step necessary to the ascent of
the diaphragm is the relaxation of its muscular
fibres. As soon as these fibres are in a
state of relaxation, that is, when the organ has
changed from an active to a completely passive
state, the powerful muscles of the abdomen (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 6, 7, 8) contract, and push the abdominal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
viscera and the diaphragm with them upwards
towards the cavity of the chest (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 2); and
thus, by the descent of the ribs and the ascent of
the diaphragm, the capacity of the thorax is diminished
in every direction, and the motion of expiration
is completed.</p>

<p><a id="para_392"></a>392. Such is the mechanism by which the
capacity of the thorax is alternately enlarged and
diminished in the two alternate states of inspiration
and expiration, and the mechanism thus
adjusted works in the following mode.</p>

<p><a id="para_393"></a>393. Expiration succeeding to the state of inspiration,
the ribs descend, the diaphragm ascends,
the capacity of the thorax lessens, and the compressed
lungs are forced within the smallest possible
space. Then, inspiration, succeeding to the
state of expiration, the ribs ascend and the diaphragm
descends; the capacity of the thorax is
enlarged, and the lungs freed from their pressure
expand and fill the greater space obtained. In
about a second and a half after the state of inspiration
has been induced, that of expiration recommences;
the motion of inspiration occupying
about double the time of the motion of expiration,
and these alternate conditions succeed each other
in a regular and uniform course, day and night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
during our sleeping and our waking hours to the
end of life.</p>

<p><a id="para_394"></a>394. As long as the function is performed in a
perfectly natural manner, a given number of these
alternate movements takes place in a certain time,
constituting what is termed the rhythm of the respiratory
motions. These motions perfectly regular in
number and time, are likewise, in the natural state
of the function, performed only with a certain
degree of energy; but they are variously modified
at the command of the will; in obedience to
numerous sensations and emotions; in the performance
of a great variety of complex actions, and
in different states of disease. These modifying
circumstances may cause the action of inspiration
to be more full and deep, and that of expiration
to be more forcible and complete than natural; or
they may cause both movements to be shorter and
quicker than common: hence the distinction of
respiration into ordinary and extraordinary.</p>

<p><a id="para_395"></a>395. In ordinary respiration, that is, when the
respiratory motions are perfectly calm and easy, the
ascent and descent of the ribs are scarcely perceptible;
the action is confined almost exclusively to
the ascent and descent of the diaphragm. In this
condition the only action of the intercostal muscles
is to fix the ribs, and thus to afford one of the two
fixed points which have been shown (<a href="#para_385">385</a>) to be
essential to the action of the diaphragm. But in
extraordinary respiration, that is, when circum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>stances
happen in the economy which require
that those motions should be extended, auxiliary
sources can be put in requisition. There are
many powerful muscles situated about the breast,
shoulder and back (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>.</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVII">CXLVII</a>. </span>);
which are capable of elevating the ribs and protruding
the sternum to a very considerable extent
(figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 1, 2, 3, 5; and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVII">CXLVII</a>. </span> 1, 2, 3).
Where, for example, the fullest inspiration which
it is possible to take is required, the bones of the
shoulder and shoulder-joint are firmly fixed by
resting the hands upon the knees, and then every
muscle which has the slightest connexion with the
thorax, either before or behind, capable of raising
the ribs, is added to the inspiratory apparatus (figs.
CXLIV. and CXLVII.); at the same time that the
abdominal muscles are relaxed to the utmost degree,
in order to facilitate the ascent of the ribs
and the descent of the diaphragm (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIV">CXLIV</a>. </span> 2,
and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>. </span> 6, 7, 8). If, on the contrary, the fullest
possible expiration is required, the abdominal
muscles contract most forcibly (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLV">CXLV</a>.</span> 2),
and every other muscle which is capable of still
farther depressing the ribs and of elevating the
diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVI">CXLVI</a>.</span> 6, 7, 8) is called into intense
action. By these forcible and extraordinary
efforts the thorax may be enlarged or diminished
double its ordinary capacity.</p>

the lungs by the dilatation of the thorax, in the
action of inspiration, is the following. The lungs
are in direct contact with the inner surface of the
thorax, and follow passively all its movements.
When the volume of the lungs is reduced to its
minimum by the diminished capacity of the
thorax, in the state of expiration, they still contain
a certain bulk of air. As their volume increases
with the enlarging capacity of the thorax in the
state of inspiration, this bulk of air having to
occupy a greater space expands. By this expansion
of the air in the interior of the lungs, it becomes
rarer than the external air. Between the
rarified air within the lungs, and the dense external
air, there is a direct communication by the
nostrils, mouth, trachea, larynx, and bronchi. In
consequence of its greater weight, the dense external
air rushes through these openings and
tubes to the lungs and fills the air vesicles, the
current continuing to flow until an equilibrium is
established between the density of the air within
the lungs and the density of the external air; and
thus there is established the flow of a current of
fresh air to the air vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="para_398"></a>398. The external air which, in obedience to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the physical law that regulates its motion, thus
rushes to the lung in order to fill the partial
vacuum created by the dilatation of the thorax in
inspiration, produces, in passing to the air vesicles,
a peculiar sound. When the lungs are perfectly
healthy, and the respiration is performed in a
natural manner, if the ear be applied to any part of
the chest, a slight noise can be distinguished both
in the action of inspiration and that of expiration.
A soft murmur, somewhat resembling the sound
produced by the deep inspirations occasionally
made by a person profoundly sleeping. This sound,
though appreciable even by the naked ear, and
though produced many times every minute, in
every healthy human being from the first moment
of the existence of the first man, had never been
heard, or at least never attended to, until about
twenty years ago, when it was observed by accident.
A physician, Dr. Laennec, of Paris, having occasion
to examine a young female labouring under,
as he supposed, some disease of the heart, and
scrupling to follow his first impulse to apply his
ear to the chest, chanced to recollect that solid
bodies have the power of conducting sounds better
than the air. Thereupon he procured a quire of
paper, rolled it up tightly, tied it, and then applied
one extremity to the patient’s chest and the
other to his ear. Profiting by the result, which
was, that he could hear the beating of the heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
infinitely more distinctly than he could possibly
feel it by the hand, he substituted for this first
rude instrument a wooden cylinder, which he called
a stethescope or chest inspector. The attentive
and practised use of this instrument is found to be
capable of revealing to the ear all that is passing
in the chest almost as clearly and certainly as it
would be visible to the eye, were the walls of the
chest and the tissues of its organs transparent.
Besides the entrance of the air into the lung in
inspiration, and its exit in expiration, even the
motion of the blood in the heart, and in the great
blood-vessels, are rendered by this instrument distinctly
manifest to sense; and as the ear which
has once become familiar with the natural sounds
produced by these operations in the state of health,
can detect the slightest deviation occasioned by
disease, the practical application of this discovery
has already effected for the pathology of the chest,
what the discovery of the circulation of the blood
has accomplished for the physiology of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_399"></a>399. At the instant that the expanding lung
admits the current of air, it receives a stream of
blood. The air rushes through the trachea to the
air vesicles impelled by its own weight; the blood
flows through the trunks of the pulmonary artery
to its capillary branches, spread out on the walls
of the air vesicles, driven by the contraction of the
right ventricle of the heart. A current of air and
a stream of blood are thus brought into so close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
an approximation that nothing intervenes between
the two fluids, but the fine membranes of which
the air vesicles and the capillary branches of the
pulmonary artery are composed, and these membranes
being pervious to the air, the air comes
into direct contact with the blood; the two fluids
re-act on each other, and in this manner is accomplished
the ultimate object of the action of
inspiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_400"></a>400. On the other hand, by the action of expiration,
the bulk of the lung is diminished; the
air vesicles are compressed, and a portion of the
air they contained, forced out of them by the
collapse of the lung, is received by the bronchi,
transmitted to the trachea, and ultimately conveyed
out of the system by the nostrils and mouth.</p>

<p><a id="para_401"></a>401. At the same instant that a portion of air
is thus expelled from the lung and carried out of
the system, a stream of blood, namely, blood which
has been acted upon by the air, arterial blood, is propelled
from the lung and is borne by the pulmonary
veins to the left side of the heart, to be transmitted
to the system (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 10, 11, 4). In this manner,
by the simultaneous expulsion from the lung of a
current of air and a stream of blood is accomplished
the ultimate object of the action of expiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_402"></a>402. That blood flows to the lung during the
action of inspiration, and is expelled from it during
the action of expiration, is established by direct
experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p><a id="para_403"></a>403. If the great vessel which returns the blood
from the head to the heart, called the jugular vein,
be exposed to view in a living animal, it is seen to
be alternately filled and emptied according to the
different states of inspiration and expiration.</p>

<p>It becomes nearly empty at the moment of inspiration,
because at that moment the venous
stream is hurried forward to the right chambers
of the heart, which in consequence of the general
dilatation of the chest are now expanded to receive
it. This may be rendered still more strikingly
manifest to the eye. If a glass tube, blown at the
middle into a globular form, be inserted by its extremities
into the jugular vein of a living animal
in such a manner that the venous stream must
pass through this globe, it is found that the globe
becomes nearly empty during inspiration, and
nearly full during expiration; empty during inspiration,
because, during this action the blood
flows forwards to the right chambers of the heart;
full during expiration, because during this action
the venous stream, retarded in its passage through
the lung, its motion becomes so slow in the jugular
vein that there is time for its accumulation in the
glass globe. In the artery, on the contrary, in
which the course of the current is the reverse of
that in the vein, the opposite result takes place. In
the carotid artery the stream is seen to be feeble
and scanty during inspiration, but forcible and full
during expiration, and if the artery be divided the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
jet of blood that issues from it absolutely stops
during the action of inspiration; and the fuller
and deeper the inspiration the longer is the interval
between the jets, while it is during the action
of expiration that the jet is full and strong.</p>

<p><a id="para_404"></a>404. In the course of some experiments performed
by Dr. Dill and myself with a view to ascertain
with greater precision the relation between
respiration and circulation, we observed a phenomenon
which places these points in a still more
clear and striking light. We happened to divide
a jugular vein. We saw that the vessel ceased to
bleed during inspiration, and that it began to
bleed copiously the moment expiration commenced;
the reverse of what uniformly happens in the entire
state of the vessel. The reason is, that the
division of the vein cuts off its communication with
the lung, removes it from the influence of respiration,
brings it under the influence, the sole influence
of the powers that move the arterial current,
and consequently reverses its natural condition,
and so reverses the manner in which its current
flows; affording a beautiful illustration of the
influence of the two actions of respiration on the
two sets of blood-vessels concerned in the function.</p>

<p><a id="para_405"></a>405. It is then the venous system that is immediately
related to inspiration, and the arterial to
expiration. Each respiratory action exerts a specific
influence over its own sanguiferous system,
and the influence of the one action is the reverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
of that of the other, as the two currents they work
flow in opposite directions. The lungs, in inspiration,
expand and receive the venous stream; in expiration,
collapse and expel the arterial stream.
The expansion of the lungs in inspiration is thus
simultaneous with the dilatation of the heart:
during the inspiratory action both organs receive
their blood. The collapse of the lungs in expiration
is simultaneous with the contraction of the
heart: during the expiratory action both organs
expel their blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_406"></a>406. We are thus enabled to form a clear and
exact conception of the mechanism and action of
both parts of this complicated function. Almost
all the points connected with the systemic circulation
were established upwards of three hundred
years ago (279), but many points connected
with the pulmonic circulation have been
established only recently. Our knowledge of the
phenomena of both, and of their mutual relation
and dependence, has been slowly increasing, and is
at length tolerably complete; and now that we
understand the exact office and working of each,
we see that the action of the one is not only in
harmony with that of the other, but co-operates
with it, and renders it perfect.</p>

<p><a id="para_407"></a>407. But although the main points relative to
the influence of inspiration and expiration over the
pulmonary circulation may be said to be universally
admitted, still physiologists are not agreed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
to the relative quantities of blood which are transmitted
through the lungs during these different
respiratory states. All are agreed that the state
of inspiration is favourable to the passage of the
blood through the lungs: some maintain that this
expansion of the lungs in inspiration is essential
to the pulmonary circulation. There is the like
general consent that the state of expiration retards
the flow of blood through the lungs; by many it
is conceived that it completely stops the current.
By these physiologists it is supposed that, during
the action of expiration, the lungs are in a state
of collapse; that they contain a comparatively
small portion of air; that in this state the air
vesicles are so compressed, and the pulmonary
blood-vessels so coiled up, that the lungs are absolutely
impermeable, and consequently, that when
the blood arrives at the right chambers of the
heart, it is incapable of making its way to the left.
This, according to a prevalent theory, is the immediate
cause of death in asphyxia, the state of
the system induced by suspended respiration, as
in drowning, hanging, and suffocation. Death
takes place in this condition of the system, it is
argued, because the circulation of the blood is
arrested at the right side of the heart, cannot permeate
the lungs, and consequently cannot reach
the left ventricle, to be sent out to supply the
organs of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_408"></a>408. This opinion, which appears at first view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
to be favoured by numerous observations and experiments,
has been shown to be fallacious by a
series of decisive experiments, performed by Dr.
Dill and myself, undertaken, as has been stated
(<a href="#para_404">404</a>), with the object of ascertaining, in a more
exact manner than had hitherto been done, the
relation between the circulation and respiration.
The previously ascertained fact that the heart
continues to beat and the blood to flow several
minutes after the complete suspension of the respiration,
or after apparent death, afforded us the
means of pursuing our research. The details of
these experiments are given elsewhere: it is sufficient
to state in this place the main results.</p>

<p><a id="para_409"></a>409. As a standard of comparison, the quantity
of blood which flows through the lungs after
apparent death, when the lungs remain in a perfectly
natural state, was previously ascertained.
It was found, after death produced in an animal
by a blow on the head, that blood continued to be
transmitted through the lungs for the space of
twenty-five minutes after the complete cessation
of respiration. There passed through the lungs
in all five ounces and two drachms of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_410"></a>410. Respiration was now suspended the instant
after a perfectly natural and easy <em>inspiration</em>;
there flowed through the lungs four ounces and
five drachms of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_411"></a>411. Respiration was next suspended the instant
after a perfectly natural and easy <em>expiration</em>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
there flowed through the lungs two ounces and
seven drachms of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_412"></a>412. When the trachea of an animal is closed
by the pressure of a cord in suspension, or when
an animal is immersed under water, it makes a
succession of violent expirations, by which a large
quantity of air is forced out of the lungs. Hence,
when the lungs of an animal that has perished by
hanging or drowning, are examined, they are
always found much reduced in bulk; so much
reduced in bulk as to have suggested the theory
that the extreme collapse of the lungs and their
consequent impermeability, is the cause of death
in this condition of the system. On bringing this
theory to the test of experiment, it was found that
blood continued to flow through the lungs after
apparent death from suspension, for the space of
eleven minutes, and that there passed through in
all five ounces of blood. The comparatively larger
quantity transmitted in this case than when the
inspiration and expiration were perfectly natural,
was owing to the larger size of the animal. In
the experiments made with a view to ascertain the
relative proportions of blood transmitted through
the lungs in the states of natural inspiration and
expiration, the animals were chosen as nearly as
possible of the same size, and were much smaller
than the former.</p>

<p><a id="para_413"></a>413. On examining the quantity of blood that
passed through the lungs after death from sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>mersion,
it was found to be very nearly the same
as that which was transmitted after death from
suspension.</p>

<p><a id="para_414"></a>414. But the lungs may be brought to a much
greater degree of collapse than that to which they
are reduced in hanging and drowning. By introducing
an exhausting syringe into the trachea, a
much larger quantity of air may be drawn out of
the lungs than they are capable of expelling by the
most violent efforts of expiration. When, in this
mode, the lungs had been reduced to the greatest
possible degree of collapse, and had been exhausted
of all the air that could be drawn out of them,
there flowed through them two ounces of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_415"></a>415. Such are the results when the lungs are
reduced successively from the moderate degree of
collapse incident to a perfectly natural expiration,
to the great degree of collapse incident to suspension
and submersion, and the most extreme
degree of collapse which it is possible to induce
by exhaustion.</p>

<p><a id="para_416"></a>416. When the phenomena that take place in
the opposite condition of the lungs were investigated,
results were obtained which present a
striking contrast to those which have been stated.
On forcing into the lungs the largest quantity of
air which they are capable of containing without
the rupture of the air vesicles, and in this manner
communicating to them the greatest degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
dilatation compatible with their integrity, it was
found that in this state there passed through them
<em>only three drachms of blood</em>.</p>

<p><a id="para_417"></a>417. But on fully distending the lungs with
water instead of air, the pulmonary circulation
was instantaneously and completely arrested; they
were incapable of transmitting a single drop of
blood. On cutting the aorta across, as in all the
preceding experiments, not a particle of blood was
obtained, excepting what issued at a single jet,
and which consisted only of the blood contained
in the vessel at the moment the respiration was
stopped.</p>

<p><a id="para_418"></a>418. From these experiments it follows—</p>

<p>1. That the state of inspiration is favorable to
the passage of the blood through the lungs. In
the dilatation of inspiration they transmitted nearly
double the quantity that passed in the collapse
of expiration; or, as four ounces and five drachms
are to two ounces and seven drachms (410 and
411).</p>

<p>2. That no degree of collapse to which the
lungs can be reduced is capable of wholly stopping
the flow of the blood through them. In the
collapse of suspension and submersion they transmitted
as much blood, with the exception of two
drachms, as when death was produced by a blow
on the head (412 and 409). In the greatest degree
of collapse capable of being produced by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
exhausting syringe, they transmitted half as much
as in the collapse of suspension and submersion
(414 and 412).</p>

<p>3. That it is only a moderate degree of
dilatation that is favorable to the transmission of
the blood through the lungs. When the lungs
are over-distended with air, they are capable of
transmitting only an exceedingly small quantity
of blood (<a href="#para_416">416</a>); when they are fully distended
with water, they are incapable of transmitting a
single drop of blood (<a href="#para_417">417</a>). In fact they can
contain only a certain quantity of air and blood;
and when either of these fluids preponderates, it
can only be by the proportionate exclusion of the
other. It will appear hereafter that these results
are capable of applications of the highest interest
and importance in the explanation of numerous
phenomena of health and of disease.</p>

<p><a id="para_419"></a>419. Physiologists have laboured with great
diligence to determine the exact quantity of air
and blood which enters and which flows from the
lung at each of the actions of respiration, and
they have succeeded in obtaining tolerably precise
results.</p>

<p><a id="para_420"></a>420. The quantity of air capable of being received
into the lungs of an adult man, in sound
health, at an inspiration, is determined with correctness
by an instrument constructed by Mr.
Green, analagous to one suggested by Mr. Abernethy.
It consists of a tin trough, about a foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
square, and six inches deep, three parts of which
are filled with water. Into this trough is placed
a three-gallon glass jar, open at the bottom, and
graduated at the side into pints, half-pints, &amp;c.
To the upper end of the jar a flexible tube is
affixed, having at its connexion a stop-cock. The
lungs being emptied, as in the ordinary action of
expiration, and the mouth applied to the end of
the flexible tube, the nostrils being closed by the
pressure of the fingers, the air is drawn out of the
jar into the lungs by the ordinary action of inspiration.
When as much air is thus drawn into the
lungs as the air vesicles will hold, the stop-cock
is closed, and the quantity of air inspired is ascertained
by the rise of the water, the level of the
water corresponding with the indications marked
on the side of the jar.</p>

<p><a id="para_421"></a>421. The quantity of air which a person by a
voluntary effort can inspire at one time is found,
as might have been anticipated, to be different in
every different individual. These varieties depend,
among other causes, on the greater or less development
of the trunk, on the presence or absence of
disease in the chest, on the degree in which the
lung is emptied of air by expiration previously to
inspiration, and on the energy of the inspiratory
effort. The greatest volume of air hitherto found
to have been received by the lung, on the most
powerful inspiration, is nine pints and a quarter.
The average quantity which the lungs are capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
of receiving in persons in good health, and free
from the accumulation of fat about the chest, appears
to be from five to seven pints. The latter
is about the average quantity capable of being inspired
by public singers.</p>

<p><a id="para_422"></a>422. But these measurements relate to the
greatest volume of air which the lungs are capable
of receiving, on the most forcible inspiration which
it is possible to make, after they have been emptied
by forcible expiration, and consequently
express the quantity received in extraordinary, not
in ordinary inspiration. The quantity received at
an inspiration easy, natural, and free from any
great effort, may be two pints and a half, but the
quantity received at an ordinary inspiration, made
without any effort at all, is, according to former
observations which referred to Winchester measure,
about one pint.</p>

<p><a id="para_423"></a>423. The quantity of air expelled from the
lung by an ordinary expiration is probably a very
little less than that received by an ordinary inspiration
(<a href="#para_456">456</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_424"></a>424. No one is able by a voluntary effort to
expel the whole contents of the lungs. Observation
and experiment lead to the conclusion that
the lungs, when moderately distended, contain at
a medium about twelve pints of air. As one pint
is inhaled at an ordinary inspiration, and somewhat
less than the same volume is expelled at an
ordinary expiration (<a href="#para_456">456</a>), there remain present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
in the lungs, at a minimum, eleven pints of air.
There is one act of respiration to four pulsations of
the heart; and, as in the ordinary state of health
there are seventy-two pulsations, so there are
eighteen respirations in a minute, or 25,920 in the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><a id="para_425"></a>425. About two ounces of blood are received
by the heart at each dilatation of the auricles;
about the same quantity is expelled from it at
each contraction of its ventricles; consequently, as
the heart dilates and contracts seventy-two times
in a minute, it sends thus often to the lungs, there
to be acted upon by the air, two ounces of blood. It
is estimated by Haller that 10,527 grains of blood
occupy the same space as 10,000 grains of water,
so that if one cubic inch of water weigh 253 grains,
the same bulk of blood will weigh 266⅓ grains.</p>

<p><a id="para_426"></a>426. It is ordinarily estimated that on an
average one circuit of the blood is performed in
150 seconds; but it is shown (451 and 452) that
the quantity of air always present in the lungs
contains precisely a sufficient quantity of oxygen
to oxygenate the blood, while flowing at the ordinary
rate of 72 contractions of the heart per
minute, for the exact space of 160 seconds. It is
therefore highly probable that this interval of
time, 160 seconds, is the exact period in which
the blood performs one circuit, and not 150
seconds, as former observations had assigned. If
this be so, then 540 circuits are performed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
twenty-four hours; that is, there are three complete
circulations of the blood through the body in
every eight minutes of time.</p>

<p><a id="para_427"></a>427. But it has been shown (<a href="#para_425">425</a>) that the
weight of the blood is to that of water as 1.0527 is
to unity, and that consequently 10,527 grains of
blood are in volume the same as 10,000 grains of
water.</p>

<p><a id="para_428"></a>428. From this it results that if in the human
adult two ounces of blood are propelled into the
lungs at each contraction of the heart, that is, 72
times in a minute, there are in the whole body
precisely 384 ounces, or 24 pounds avoirdupois,
which measure 692.0657 cubic inches, or within
one cubic inch of 20 imperial pints, which measure
693.1847 cubic inches.</p>

<p><a id="para_429"></a>429. By an elaborate series of calculations
from these data Mr. Finlaison has deduced the
following general results:—</p>

<p>1. As there are four pulsations to one respiration
(<a href="#para_424">424</a>), there are 8 ounces of blood, measuring
14.418 cubic inches, presented to 10.5843 grains
of air, measuring 34.24105 cubic inches.</p>

<p>2. The whole contents of the lungs is equal to
a volume of very nearly 411 cubic inches full of
air, weighing 127 grains, of which 29.18132 grains
are oxygen.</p>

<p>3. In the space of five-sixth parts of one
second of time, two ounces, or 960 grains weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of blood, measuring 3⅗ or 3.60451 cubic inches,
are presented for aëration.</p>

<p>4. Therefore the air contained in the lungs is
114 times the bulk of the blood presented, while
the weight of the blood so presented is 7½ times as
great as the weight of the air contained.</p>

<p>5. In one minute of time the fresh air inspired
amounts to 616⅓ cubic inches, or as nearly as may
be 18 pints, weighing 190½ grains.</p>

<p>6. In one hour the quantity inspired amounts
to 1066⅔ pints, or 2 hogsheads, 20 gallons, and
10⅔ pints, weighing 23¾ ounces and 31 grains.</p>

<p>7. In one day it amounts to 57 hogsheads,
1 gallon, and 7¼ pints, weighing 571½ ounces and
25 grains (<a href="#para_454">454</a>).</p>

<p>8. To this volume of air there are presented
for aëration in one minute of time 144 ounces of
blood, in volume 259½ cubic inches, which is
within 18 cubic inches of an imperial gallon.</p>

<p>9. In one hour 540 pounds avoirdupois, measuring
449¼ pints, or 1 hogshead and 1¼ pints;—and</p>

<p>10. In the twenty-four hours, in weight 12,960
pounds; in bulk 10,782½ pints, that is, 24 hogsheads
and 4 gallons.</p>

<p>11. Thus, in round numbers, there flow to the
human lungs every minute nearly 18 pints of air
(besides the 12 pints constantly in the air vesicles)
and nearly 8 pints of blood; but in the space of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
twenty-four hours, upwards of 57 hogsheads of air
and 24 hogsheads of blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_430"></a>430. Provision cannot have been made for
bringing into contact such immense quantities of
air and blood, unless important changes are to be
produced in both fluids; and accordingly it is
found that the air is essentially changed by its
contact with the blood, and the blood by its contact
with the air.</p>

<p><a id="para_431"></a>431. Chemistry has demonstrated the changes
effected in the air. Common atmospheric air is
a compound body, consisting of pure air and
of certain substances diffused in it. Pure air
is composed of two gases, azote and oxygen,
always combined in fixed proportions. The
substances diffused in pure air, and which are
in variable quantity, are aqueous vapour and
carbonic acid gas. These latter substances form
no part of the chemical agents essentially concerned
in the process of respiration. The only
constituents of the air which are essentially concerned
in the process of respiration are the two
gases, azote and oxygen, the union of which, in
definite proportions, constitutes pure air. But of
these two gases each does not perform the same
part in the function of respiration, nor is each
equally necessary to the support of life.</p>

<p><a id="para_432"></a>432. If a living animal be placed in a vessel
full of atmospheric air, and if all communication
of the atmosphere with the vessel be prevented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the animal in a given time perishes. If an animal
be placed in a vessel full of azote, after a given
time it equally perishes; but if an animal be
placed in a vessel full of oxygen, not only is the
function of respiration carried on with far greater
energy than in atmospheric air, but the animal
lives a much longer time than in the same bulk
of the latter fluid. If twenty cubic inches of pure
oxygen be capable of sustaining the life of an
animal for the space of fourteen minutes, it can
support life in the same bulk of atmospheric air
only six minutes; and if its respiration be confined
to either of these gases, after they have been
already respired by another animal of the same
species, the former will live only four minutes;
that is, not longer than when entirely deprived of
air. It follows that the gas which gives to
atmospheric air its chief power of sustaining life
is oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="para_433"></a>433. Accordingly it is proved that no animal,
from the lowest to the highest, is capable of sustaining
life unless a certain proportion of oxygen
be present in the fluid which it respires. Whether
it breathe by the skin, by gills, or by lungs,
whether the respiratory medium be water or air,
the presence of oxygen is alike indispensable. Yet
the life of no animal can be sustained by pure
oxygen. If azote be not mixed with oxygen, evils
are produced in the economy which sooner or later
prove fatal. On the other hand, if the proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of oxygen be diminished beyond a certain point,
drowsiness, torpor, and death result. Not oxygen
alone, then, but oxygen combined with azote, in
the proportion in which nature has united these
two fluids to form the atmosphere of the globe, is
indispensable to animal existence.</p>

<p><a id="para_434"></a>434. When the same portion of atmospheric
air is repeatedly respired by an animal, the oxygen
contained in it gradually disappears, the gas
lessening with every successive respiration, until
at last so small a quantity remains that it is no
longer capable of sustaining the life of an animal
of that class. When respiration has deprived the
air of its oxygen to such an extent, that it can no
longer support animal life, the air is said to be
consumed; but, correctly speaking, it is merely
changed in composition, in the proportions in
which its constituents are combined; consequently
the effect of respiration is to alter the chemical
composition of the air.</p>

<p><a id="para_435"></a>435. The essential change that takes place
consists in the diminution of the oxygen and the
increase of the carbonic acid. When inspired,
atmospheric air goes to the lungs loaded with
oxygen; when expired, it returns loaded with
carbonic acid. That the air which returns from
the lungs is loaded with carbonic acid, may be
rendered manifest even to the eye. If a person
breathe through a tube into water holding lime in
solution, the carbonic acid contained in the ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>pired
air will unite with the lime and form a
white powder analogous to chalk (carbonate of
lime), which being insoluble, becomes visible.</p>

<p><a id="para_436"></a>436. On the other hand, the diminution of
oxygen is demonstrated by chemical analysis. If
100 parts of atmospheric air be successively
respired, until it is no longer capable of supporting
life, and if it be then subjected to analysis, it is
found that in place of being composed of 79 parts
azote, 21 oxygen, and a variable quantity of carbonic
acid, sometimes amounting to half a grain
per cent., it consists of 77 parts azote, and 23
carbonic acid. The oxygen is gone, and is replaced
by 23 parts of carbonic acid; at least this
is the ordinary estimate; but different experimentalists
differ somewhat in their account of the
absolute quantity of oxygen that disappears, and
of carbonic acid that is generated.</p>

<p><a id="para_437"></a>437. Whatever estimates of the oxygen consumed,
and of the carbonic acid generated, be
adopted, they can be taken only as medium quantities.
Dr. Edwards has demonstrated that the
absolute quantity of oxygen consumed in a given
time is constantly varying, not only in animals of
different species, but even in the same animal under
different circumstances; insomuch, that there are
scarcely two hours in the day in which the same
individual expends precisely the same quantity.
The nature and degree of the exercise taken
during the observation, the condition of the mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the state of the health, the kind of food, the temperature
of the air, and innumerable other causes
materially influence the quantity of oxygen consumed.
When, for example, the hourly consumption
of oxygen, at the temperature of 54° Fahrenheit,
amounted to 1345 cubic inches,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> it fell, at
the temperature of 79°, to 1210 cubic inches.
During the process of digestion more is consumed
than when the stomach is empty; more is required
when the diet is animal than when it is vegetable,
and more when the body and mind are active than
when at rest.</p>

<p><a id="para_438"></a>438. With regard to the carbonic acid, Dr. Prout
has recently made the remarkable discovery, not
only that the generation of this gas differs according
to different circumstances, and more especially
according to particular states of the system; but
that the quantity of it which is produced regularly
varies at particular periods of the day. The quantity
generated is always more abundant during the
day than during the night. About daybreak it
begins to increase; continues to do so until noon,
when it comes to its maximum, and then decreases
until sunset. The maximum quantity generated
at noon exceeds the minimum by about one-fifth of
the whole. If from any cause the relative quantity
be either increased or diminished above or below
the ordinary maximum or minimum, it is invariably</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>
<p>diminished or increased in an equal proportion
during some subsequent diurnal period. The absolute
quantity generated is materially diminished
by the operation of any debilitating cause, such as
low diet, protracted fasting, or long-continued
exercise, depressing passions and the like. Few
circumstances of any kind increase the quantity
produced, and those only in a slight degree.</p>

<p><a id="para_439"></a>439. The changes produced by respiration on
the other constituent of the air, azote, appear at
first view to be extremely variable. By numerous
and accurate experiments it is established that the
quantity of this gas is at one time increased; at
another diminished, and at another unchanged.
It is probable that there is a constant absorption
and exhalation of it; and that the apparent irregularity
is the result of the preponderance of the one
process over the other. When absorption preponderates,
a smaller quantity is found in the air expired
than in that inspired: when exhalation preponderates,
a larger quantity is expired than inspired;
and when the absorption and exhalation
are equal, just as much is expired as inspired, and
consequently there appears to be no absorption
at all.</p>

<p><a id="para_440"></a>440. Such are the phenomena of respiration,
as far as the labours of physiologists has succeeded
in ascertaining them, up to the present time. But
as the estimates of the quantity of air and blood
contained in the lungs were rather matters of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>jecture
than of demonstration, and as the quantity
of oxygen consumed, of carbonic acid generated,
and of azote absorbed, appeared still not to be
determined with exactness, I requested Mr. Finlaison
to apply his power of calculation to the
investigation of this subject, taking as the basis of
his calculations the facts positively and precisely
ascertained by experiment and analysis. This he
has done with great care, and has obtained the
following results.</p>

<p><a id="para_441"></a>441. It was formerly estimated that the weight
of pure atmospheric air is 305,000 grains troy for
one million of cubic inches; but the latest authorities
assign it to be 310,117 grains. Of this
weight of one million of cubic inches of pure air,</p>

<p>Ten inches of pure air are equal in weight to

<p>Eight inches of azote are equal in weight to
seven of oxygen.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of carbonic acid is to pure
air at the rate of 15,277 to 10,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>The specific gravity of the vapour of water is to
pure air as 6,230 to 10,000. It follows that a
million of cubic inches of air in its ordinary state
weigh 309,111½ grains.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas is composed of oxygen and
pure carbon in the proportion of eight grains of
oxygen to three of carbon out of every eleven
grains of carbonic acid.</p>

<p><a id="para_443"></a>443. Though during particular portions in the
twenty-four hours, under circumstances which influence
variously the actions of life (437 and 438),
the quantity of the oxygen consumed, of carbonic
acid generated, and of azote absorbed, vary (436 to
439), yet it is probable that the daily consumption,
reproduction, and absorption of these gases, is pretty
much the same one day with another. The experiments
of Dr. Edwards clearly show that while
these quantities vary to such an extent, when
the observation embraces only a short interval, as
to be scarcely ever the same hour by hour, yet that
they lessen as the interval extends, until at length
a nearly exact equilibrium is established.</p>

<p><a id="para_444"></a>444. Experimental philosophers have not obtained
precisely the same results as to the quantities
consumed and reproduced of these respective
gases. At present, therefore, we can only approximate
to the exact amount by taking the
average of their observations. The following are
the results of the principal experiments which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
have been instituted. The quantity of oxygen
consumed by an adult man in twenty-four hours
is, according to</p>

<p>The weight of 38,268 inches of carbonic acid
gas is 18,130.1474 grains troy; and the weight of
45,731½ inches of oxygen is 15,757.9131 grains
troy.</p>

<p>Now this weight of oxygen must have been
derived from the decomposition of 221,882 cubic
inches of common atmospheric air.</p>

<p><a id="para_446"></a>446. It has been shown that, in the state of
health, one contraction of the heart propels to the
lungs two ounces of blood; that this action of the
heart is repeated 72 times in one minute; that to
every four actions of the heart there is one action
of respiration; that consequently there are 18
respirations in a minute, and 25,920 in the twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p><a id="para_447"></a>447. From these premises it results that at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
each action of the heart there is decomposed of
the air inspired, 8.5603 cubic inches, that is, a
quarter of a pint within one-tenth of a cubic inch,—the
quarter of a pint imperial measure being
8.6648 cubic inches.</p>

<p><a id="para_448"></a>448. Previous observation had assigned one
pint as the volume of air ordinarily inhaled at a
single inspiration. We now see that the quantity
decomposed is a quarter of a pint. It is, then, an
absolute truth, that of the whole volume of air
inspired, one-fourth part only is decomposed, and
that three-fourths, after having been diffused
through the air vesicles of the lungs, are expired
without change.</p>

<p><a id="para_449"></a>449. Observation had also assigned 12 pints
of air as the volume constantly present in the
lungs,</p>

</p>

<p><a id="para_450"></a>450. It is then concluded that the real contents
of the lungs is a volume of 410.8926 cubic
inches, which is exactly the 540th part of 221,882
cubic inches, being the whole volume decomposed
in twenty-four hours. But 160 seconds is also
exactly the 540th part of the number of seconds
in twenty-four hours.</p>

stopped, provision is made by the quantity of air
always retained in the lungs for the oxygenation
of the blood while flowing at the ordinary rate of
72 strokes per minute, for the exact space of 160
seconds, and for not one instant longer.</p>

<p><a id="para_453"></a>453. This interval of time, then, as has been
stated (<a href="#para_426">426</a>), is very probably the time in which
the blood performs one circuit, not 150 seconds.
Then 540 circuits are performed in the twenty-four
hours, or 3 circuits in every eight minutes.

of blood contained in the whole body of the human
adult (<a href="#para_428">428</a>).</p>

<p>And thus the weight of carbon discharged by the
blood is precisely compensated by the united
weight of the oxygen and azote which it has absorbed.</p>

<p><a id="para_460"></a>460. Since it appears to be a general truth
that one quarter of the air respired is decomposed,
and that the volume of air continually present in
the lungs is sufficient for that consumption of
oxygen which is requisite in 160 seconds of time,
<em>if that volume be</em>, as is apparent, 48 <em>times the
quantity decomposed</em> out of a single respiration,
no error in the quantity of oxygen consumed in
the twenty-four hours, which we have assumed,
will affect the time of 160 seconds. For there
being 18 × 60 × 24 respirations, and 60 × 60 × 24
seconds of time in the twenty-four hours, the 48th
part of the first, and the 160th part of the last
product is equally the 540th part of the whole,
whatever it may be.</p>

<p><a id="para_461"></a>461. But if the time in which a circuit of the
blood is performed be, as is most evident, identical
with the time in which the whole volume of air in
the lungs is decomposed, and if such period of
time were, as the old observers have assigned, 150<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
seconds, then it would follow that only 45 times the
quantity of air decomposed at a breath is present in
the lungs, amounting to 385¼ cubic inches, and that
the whole blood in the body is 24 ounces less than on
the supposition of 160 seconds, that is to say, only
360 ounces, or 22½ pounds avoirdupois. Because
the 45th part of 18 × 60 × 24 is the same as the
150th part of 60 × 60 × 24; in each it is the 567th
part of the whole.</p>

<p><a id="para_462"></a>462. From the whole of these observations
and calculations the following general results are
deduced:—</p>

<p>1. The volume of air ordinarily present in the
lungs is very nearly twelve pints (<a href="#para_449">449</a>).</p>

<p>2. The volume of air received by the lungs at
an ordinary inspiration is one pint (<a href="#para_422">422</a>).</p>

<p>3. The volume of air expelled from the lungs
at an ordinary expiration is a very little less than
one pint (<a href="#para_456">456</a>).</p>

<p>4. Of the volume of air received by the lungs
at one inspiration, only one-fourth part is decomposed
at one action of the heart (<a href="#para_447">447</a>).</p>

<p>5. The fourth part of the volume of air received
by the lungs at one inspiration, and decomposed at
one action of the heart, is so decomposed in the
five-sixth parts of one second of time (429.3).</p>

<p>6. The time in which a circuit of blood is performed
is identical with the time in which the
whole volume of air in the lungs is decomposed
(<a href="#para_461">461</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>7. The whole volume of air decomposed in
twenty-four hours is 221,882 cubic inches, exactly
540 times the volume of the contents of the lungs;
160 seconds being also exactly the 540th part of
the number of seconds in twenty-four hours (<a href="#para_450">450</a>).</p>

<p>8. The quantity of the blood that flows to the
lungs to be acted upon by the air at one action of
the heart is two ounces (<a href="#para_425">425</a>).</p>

<p>9. This quantity of blood is acted upon by the
air in the five-sixth parts of one second of time
(429.3).</p>

<p>10. One circuit of the blood is performed in
160 seconds of time. Three circuits are performed
every eight minutes; 540 circuits are performed
in the twenty-four hours (<a href="#para_453">453</a>).</p>

<p>11. The quantity of blood in the whole body
of the human adult is 24 pounds avoirdupois, or
20 pints imperial measure (<a href="#para_428">428</a>).</p>

<p>12. In the space of twenty-four hours, 57
hogsheads of air flow to the lungs (429.7).</p>

<p>13. In the same space of time 24 hogsheads of
blood are presented in the lungs to this quantity of
air (424.10).</p>

<p>14. In the mutual action that takes place
between these quantities of air and blood, the air
loses 15,757.9131 grains, or 328¼ ounces of oxygen,
and the blood 10 ounces and 116 grains of carbon
(<a href="#para_445">445</a>).</p>

<p>15. The blood, while circulating through the
lungs, permanently retains and carries into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
system—of oxygen, 2,648,809 grams; and of
azote, 2,267,104 grains (<a href="#para_458">458</a>).</p>

<p>16. The ultimate results are two:—</p>

<p>1st. While the chemical composition of the
blood is essentially changed, its weight amidst all
these complicated actions is maintained steadily
the same; for the weight of carbon which is discharged
by the blood is precisely compensated by
the united weight of the oxygen and azote which
it absorbs (<a href="#para_459">459</a>).</p>

<p>2ndly. The distribution of quantities is universally
by proportions or multiples. Thus, of the
air inspired, one measure is decomposed and three
measures are returned unchanged: of the air decomposed
at a single inspiration, there are always
in store in the lungs precisely forty-eight measures;
and so on in many other cases. The proportions are
not arithmetical, but geometrical. When we compare
arithmetical quantities with each other, we
say that one quantity is by so much greater than
another; when we compare geometrical quantities,
we say that one quantity is so many times greater
than another. From this adoption in the distribution
of quantities of geometrical proportions it
results that whatever be the size of the animal the
ratios remain uniformly the same, and that thus one
and the same law is adapted to the vital agencies
of living beings under every possible diversity of
magnitude and circumstance.</p>

<p><a id="para_463"></a>463. Such are the interesting and important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
properties and relations deducible from the phenomena
of respiration. The disappearance of oxygen
and azote from the air inspired, and the replacement
of the oxygen that disappears by the production
of carbonic acid, and of the azote by the exhalation
of azote, in which, as we have seen, the
great changes wrought by respiration on the air
consist, are essentially the same in all animals,
whatever the medium breathed, and whatever the
rank of the animal in the scale of organization.
In all, the proportion of the oxygen of the inspired
air is diminished;—in all, carbonic acid gas
is produced. Comparing, then, the ultimate result
of the function of respiration in the two great
classes of living beings, it follows that the plant
and the animal produce directly opposite changes in
the chemical constitution of the air. The carbonic
acid produced by the animal is decomposed by the
plant, which retains the carbon in its own system
and returns the oxygen to the air. On the other
hand, the oxygen evolved by the plant is absorbed
by the animal, which in its turn exhales carbonic
acid for the re-absorption of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="para_464"></a>464. Thus the two great classes of organized
beings renovate the air for each other, and maintain
it in a state of perpetual purity. The plant, it is
true, absorbs oxygen during the night as well as
the animal; but the quantity which it gives off in
the day more than compensates for that which it
abstracts in the absence of light. This interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
fact has been recently established by an extended
series of experiments instituted by Professor
Daubeney<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> for the express purpose of investigating
this point.</p>

<p><a id="para_465"></a>465. From the general tenor of these experiments,
it appears that, in fine weather and as long
as the plant is healthy, it adds to the atmosphere
an amount of oxygen not only sufficient to compensate
for the quantity it abstracts in the absence
of light, but to counterpoise the effects produced
by the respiration of the whole animal kingdom.
The result of one of these experiments will convey
some conception of the amount of oxygen evolved.
A quantity of leaves about fifty in number were enclosed
in a jar of air; the surface of all the leaves
taken together was calculated at about three
hundred square inches; by the action of these
leaves on the carbonic acid introduced into the jar,
there was added to the air contained in it no less
than twenty-six cubic inches of oxygen. As there
was reason to conclude that the evolution of oxygen,
in the circumstances under which this experiment
was performed, was considerably less than it would
have been in the open air, several plants were introduced
into the same jar of air in pretty quick</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>
<p>succession: the amount of oxygen now evolved was
increased from twenty-one to thirty-nine per cent.,
and probably had not even then attained the limit
to which the increase of this constituent might
have been brought. From the proportions of the
constituent elements of carbonic acid gas (<a href="#para_442">442</a>) it
necessarily follows that, by the mere process of
decomposition, out of every eleven grains of carbonic
acid gas eight grains of oxygen must be
liberated, three grains of carbon being retained by
the plant, and consequently that eight grains of
oxygen must be restored to the atmosphere, less
only by so much as the plant itself may absorb.
How great, then, must be the production of oxygen
by an entire tree under favourable circumstances;
that is, when animal respiration and animal putrefaction
present to it an abundant supply of carbonic
acid on which to act!</p>

<p><a id="para_466"></a>466. This influence, says Professor Daubeney, is
not exerted exclusively by plants of any particular
kind or description. I have found it alike in the
monocotyledonous and dycotyledonous; in such
as thrive in sunshine and those which prefer the
shade; in the aquatic as well as in those of a more
complicated organization. How low in the scale
of vegetable life this power extends is not yet exactly
ascertained; the point at which it stops is
probably that at which there ceases to be leaves.</p>

<p><a id="para_467"></a>467. From the whole, then, it appears that the
functions of the plant have a strict relation to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
of the animal; that the plant, created to afford
subsistence to the animal, derives its nutriment
from principles which the animal rejects as excrementitious,
and that the vegetable and animal
kingdoms are so beautifully adjusted, that the very
existence of the plant depends upon its perpetual
abstraction of that, without the removal of which
the existence of the animal could not be maintained.</p>

<p><a id="para_468"></a>468. The changes produced upon the blood
by the action of respiration are no less striking
and important than those produced upon the air.
The blood contained in the pulmonary artery,
venous blood (fig. 140-7.), is of a purple or modena
red colour: the moment the air transmitted
to the blood by the bronchial tubes comes into
contact with it, in the rete mirabile (fig. 140-10.),
this purple blood is converted into blood of a bright
scarlet colour. Precisely the same change is produced
upon the blood by its contact with the air out
of the body. If a clot of venous blood be introduced
into a vessel of air, the clot speedily passes from a
purple to a scarlet colour; and if the air contained
in the vessel be analyzed, it is found that a large
portion of its oxygen has disappeared, and that the
oxygen is replaced by a proportionate quantity of
carbonic acid. If the clot be exposed to pure
oxygen, this change takes place more rapidly and
to a greater extent; if to air containing no oxygen,
no change of colour takes place.</p>

<p><a id="para_469"></a>469. The elements of the blood upon which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
portion of the air exerts its action are carbon and
hydrogen. The oxygen of the air unites with the
carbon of the blood and forms carbonic acid, and
this gas is expelled from the system by the action
of expiration. The constituent of the blood which
affords carbon to the air would appear to be chiefly
the red particles. The other portion of the oxygen
of the air unites with the hydrogen which is expelled
with the carbonic acid in the form of aqueous
vapour. The direct and immediate effect of the
action of respiration upon the blood is then to
free it from a quantity of carbon and hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="para_470"></a>470. Physiologists are not agreed whether the
union of the oxygen of the air with the carbon of
the blood takes place in the lungs or in the system.
Some experimentalists maintain that the oxygen
which disappears from the air, and that which is
contained in the carbonic acid, are exactly equivalent,
so that no oxygen can be absorbed.
According to this view, which has been clearly
shown to be incorrect (<a href="#para_459">459</a>), the effect of respiration
is merely to burn the carbon of the
blood, just as the oxygen of the air burns wood
in a common fire, the result of this combustion
being the generation of carbonic acid, which is
expelled from the system the moment it is formed.</p>

<p><a id="para_471"></a>471. The theory of Dr. Crawford is essentially
the same, which supposes that venous blood contains
a peculiar compound of carbon and hydrogen,
termed <em>hydro-carbon</em>, the elements of which unite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
in the lungs with the oxygen of the air, forming
water with the one and carbonic acid with the
other. Mr. Cooper, for many years past, has
taught the same doctrine in his lectures, without
any knowledge of the fact that Crawford had
suggested a similar modification of his theory.</p>

<p><a id="para_472"></a>472. It is now established that more oxygen
disappears than is accounted for by the amount of
carbonic acid that is generated. The experiments
of Dr. Edwards had already shown this in so decisive
a manner that physiologists almost universally
admitted it as an ascertained fact. The calculations
of Mr. Finlaison, to whom the opinions of
physiologists on this point were unknown, have
now determined the precise amount of oxygen
(444 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), and the probable amount of azote
(<a href="#para_459">459</a>) absorbed. By many physiologists it is supposed
that the oxygen retained by the lungs, as
long as it remains in this organ, enters only into a
state of loose combination with the blood; that in
this state of loose combination, it is carried from
the lungs into the general system; and that it is
only in the system that the union becomes intimate
and complete. According to this view, the
lungs are merely the portal by which the substances
employed in respiration are received and
discharged, the essential changes induced taking
place in the system. That it is through the lungs
that the oxygen required by the system is received,
is an opinion founded on experiments no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
exact than decisive; it is in accordance with the
most probable theory of the production and distribution
of animal heat (chap. ix.); and the preponderance
of evidence in its favour is so great that,
in the present state of our knowledge, it may be considered
as established; but it will appear hereafter
that the lungs are by no means passive in the process,
and that, physiologically considered, they as
truly constitute a gland secreting carbonic acid gas
as the liver is a gland secreting bile.</p>

<p><a id="para_473"></a>473. Such are the main facts which have been
ascertained relative to respiration, as far as this
function is performed by the lungs. But the liver
is a respiratory organ as well as the lungs. It decarbonizes
the blood. It carries on this process
to such an extent, that some physiologists are of
opinion that the liver is the chief organ by which
the decarbonization of the blood is effected. The
following considerations show that whatever be the
relative amount of its action, the liver powerfully
co-operates with the lungs in the performance of a
respiratory function.</p>

<p>1. The liver, like the lungs, is a receptacle of venous
blood; blood loaded with carbon. The
great venous trunk which ramifies through the
lungs is the pulmonary artery, containing all the
blood which has finished its circuit through the
system. The great venous trunk which ramifies
through the liver is the vena portæ, containing all
the blood which has finished its circuit through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
apparatus of digestion. The liver is a secreting
organ, distinguished from every other secreting
organ by elaborating its peculiar secretion from
venous blood. Carbon is abstracted from the
venous blood that flows through the lungs in the
form of carbonic acid; carbon is abstracted from
the venous blood that flows through the liver in the
form of bile.</p>

<p>2. All aliment, but more especially vegetable food,
contains a large portion of carbon, more it would
appear than the lungs can evolve. The excess is secreted
from the blood by the liver, in the form of
resin, colouring matter, fatty matter, mucus, and
the principal constituents of the bile. All these
substances contain a large proportion of carbon.
After accomplishing certain secondary purposes in
the process of digestion, these biliary matters,
loaded with carbon, are carried out of the system
together with the non-nutrient portion of the aliment.
In the decarbonizing process performed
by the lungs and the liver, the chief difference
would seem, then, to be in the mode in which the
carbon that is separated is carried out of the system.
In the lungs it is evolved, as has been stated, in
union with oxygen in the form of carbonic acid;
in the liver, in union with hydrogen in the form
of resin and fatty matter.</p>

<p>3. Accordingly, in tracing the organization of
the animal body from the commencement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
scale, it is found that among the distinct and
special organs that are formed, the liver is one of
the very first. It would appear to be constructed
as soon as the economy of the animal requires a
higher degree of respiration than can be effected
by the nearly homogeneous substance of which,
very low down in the scale, the body is composed.
Invariably through the whole animal series,
the magnitude of the liver is in the inverse ratio
to that of the lungs. The larger, the more perfectly
developed the lungs, the smaller the liver; and conversely,
the larger the liver the smaller and the less
perfectly developed the lungs. This is so uniform
that it may be considered as a law of the animal
economy. In the highly organized warm-blooded
animal, with its large lungs, divided into numerous
lobes, and each lobe composed of minute vesicles
respiring only air, the magnitude of the liver compared
with that of the body is small. In the less
highly organized animal of the same class, with
its smaller and less perfectly developed lung, respiring
partly air and partly water, the liver increases
as the lung diminishes in size. In the
reptile with its little vesicular lung, divided into
large cells, the liver is proportionally of greater
magnitude. In the fish which has no lung, but
which respires by the less highly organized gill,
and only in the medium of water, the proportionate
size of the liver is still greater; but in the mollus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>cous
animal, in which the lung or the gill is still
less perfectly developed, the bulk of the liver is
prodigious.</p>

<p>4. In all animals the quantity of venous blood
which is sent to the liver increases, as that transmitted
to the lung diminishes. In the higher
animal the great venous trunk which ramifies
through the liver (the vena portæ) is formed by
the veins of the stomach, intestines, spleen, and
pancreas, which are the only organs that transmit
their blood to the liver. In the reptile, besides all
these organs, the hind legs, the pelvis, the tail, the
intercostal veins forming the vena azygos and in some
orders of this class, even the kidneys also send
their blood to the liver; but in the fish, in addition
to all the preceding organs, the apparatus of reproduction
likewise transmits its blood to the liver.
The very formation of the venous system in the
different classes of animals seems thus to point to
the liver as a compensating and supplementary
organ to the lung.</p>

<p>5. The permanent organs in the lower animal
are a type of the transitory forms through which
the organs of the higher animal pass in the progress
of their growth. Thus the liver of the
human fœtus is of such a disproportionate size, as
to approximate it closely to that of the fish or of
the reptile. After the birth of the human embryo,
respiration is effected in part by the lung; but before
birth the lung is inactive, no air reaches it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
it contributes nothing to respiration; the decarbonizing
action of the blood is accomplished, not
by the lung, but by the liver; hence the prodigious
bulk of the fœtal liver and its activity in the secretion
of bile, and especially towards the latter
months of pregnancy, when all the organs are
greatly advanced in size and completeness.</p>

<p>6. Pathology confirms the evidence derived from
comparative anatomy and physiology. When the
function of the lung is interrupted by disease, the
activity of the liver is increased. In inflammation
of the lung (pneumonia); in the deposition of
adventitious matter in the lung (tubercles), by
which the air vesicles are compressed and obliterated,
the lung loses the power of decarbonizing
the blood in proportion to the extent and severity
of the disease with which it is affected. In this
case the secretion of bile is increased. In diseases
of the heart the liver is enlarged. In the morbus
cæruleus (<a href="#para_516">516</a>) the liver retains through life its
fœtal state of disproportion.</p>

<p>7. In the last place, there is a striking illustration
of the respiratory action of the liver, in the
vicarious office which it performs for the lung,
during the heat of summer in cold, and all the
year round in hot climates. In the heat of summer,
and more especially in the intense and constant
heat of a warm climate, in consequence of the rarefaction
of the air, respiration by the lung is less
active and efficient than in the winter of the cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
climate. During the exposure of the body to this
long-continued heat, there is a tendency to the accumulation
of carbon in the blood. An actual accumulation
is prevented, by an increased activity
in the secretion of bile, to which the liver is stimulated
by the heat. In order to obtain the material
for the formation of this unusual quantity of
bile, it abstracts carbon largely from the blood;
to this extent it compensates for the diminished
efficiency of the lung, and thus removes through
the vena portæ that superfluous carbon which
would otherwise have been excreted through the
pulmonary artery.</p>

<p><a id="para_474"></a>474. Taking life in its most extended sense,
as comprehending both the circles it includes, the
organic and the animal (vol. i. chap. 2), it may be
said to have three great centres, of which two relate
to the organic, and the third to the animal
life (vol. i. chap. 2). The two centres which relate
to the organic life are the systems of respiration
and circulation; the third, which relates to the
animal life, is the nervous system. Of the organic
life, the lungs and the heart are the primary
seats; of the animal, the brain and the spinal
cord. Between each the bond of union is so
close, that any lesion of the one influences the
other, and neither can exist without the support
of all. They form a triple chain, the breaking of
a single link of which destroys the whole.</p>

<p><a id="para_475"></a>475. But of these three great centres of life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
upon which all the other vital phenomena depend,
the most essential is respiration; hence, to consider
the relation of this function to the others, is
to take the most comprehensive view of the uses
which respiration serves in the economy.</p>

<p><a id="para_476"></a>476. The first and most important use of the
function of respiration is to maintain the action of
the organs of the animal life. It has been shown
(vol. i. chap. 2) that the organic is subservient to
the animal life, and that to build up the apparatus
of the latter, and to maintain it in a condition fit
for performing its functions, is the final end of the
former. The direct and the immediate effect of
the suspension of respiration is the abolition of
both functions of the animal life—sensation and
voluntary motion. If a ligature be placed around
the trachea of a living animal so as completely to
exclude all access of air to the lungs, and if the
carotid artery be then opened, and the blood
allowed to flow, the bright scarlet-coloured blood
contained in the artery is observed gradually to
change to a purple hue. The exact point of time
at which this change begins may be noted. It
is seen to assume a darker tinge at the end of half
a minute; at the end of one minute its colour is
still darker, and at the end of one minute and a
half, or at most two minutes (<a href="#para_426">426</a>), it is no longer
possible to distinguish it from venous blood. As
soon as this change of colour begins to be visible
the animal becomes uneasy; his agitation increases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
as the colour deepens; and when it becomes completely
dark, that instant the animal falls down
insensible. If in this state of insensibility air be
readmitted to the lungs, the dark colour of the blood
rapidly changes to a bright scarlet, and instantly
sensation and consciousness return. But if, on the
contrary, the exclusion of the air be continued for
the space of three minutes from the first closing of
the trachea, the animal not only remains to all appearance
dead, but in general no means are
capable of recovering him from the state of insensibility;
and if the exclusion of the air be protracted
to four minutes, apparent passes into real
death, and recovery is no longer possible. It
follows that one of the conditions essential to the
exercise of the function of the brain is, that this
organ receive a due supply of arterial blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_477"></a>477. The second use of the function of respiration
is to afford blood capable of maintaining
the muscles in a condition fit for the performance
of their peculiar office, that of contractility. The
closure of the trachea not only abolishes sensation,
but the power of voluntary motion: sensation
and motion are lost at once: on the re-admission
of air to the lungs, both functions are regained at
once: it follows that the process of respiration is
as essential to the action of the muscle as to that
of the brain. “By arterial blood,” says Young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
“the muscles are furnished with a store of that
unknown principle by which they are rendered
capable of contracting.” “The oxygen absorbed
by the blood,” says Spalanzani, “unites with the
muscular fibres and endows them with their contractility.”
It is more correct to say, respiration
takes carbon from the blood and gives it oxygen,
and by this means endows the blood with the
power of maintaining the contractility of the
muscular fibre.</p>

<p><a id="para_478"></a>478. But respiration is as essential to the
action of the organs of the organic life as to those
of the animal. In a short time after the respiration
ceases, the circulation stops. When the
blood is no longer changed in the lungs, it soon
loses all power of motion in the system; because
venous blood paralyses the muscular fibres of the
heart as of the arm. When the left ventricle of
the heart sends out venous blood to the system, it
propels it into its own nutrient arteries, as well as
into the other arteries of the body; into the coronary
arteries, as well as into the other branches of
the aorta; the heart loses its contractility, for
the same reason as every muscle under the like
privation; because venous instead of arterial blood
flows in its nutrient arteries; and the circulation
stops when the heart is no longer contractile,
because the engine is destroyed that works the
current.</p>

<p><a id="para_479"></a>479. Venous blood consists of chyle, the nutritive
fluid formed from the aliment; of lymph, a
fluid composed of organic particles, which having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
already formed an actual part of the solid structures
of the body, are now returning to the lungs to
receive a higher elaboration; and of blood which,
having completed its circuit through the system,
and there given off its nutrient and received excrementitious
matter, is now returning to the lungs
for depuration and renovation. These commingled
fluids, on parting in the lungs with carbonic acid
and water, and on receiving in return oxygen and
azote, are converted into arterial blood; that is,
blood more coagulable than venous, and richer in
albumen, fibrin, and red particles, the proximate
organic principles of all animal structures. The
rich and pure stream thus formed is sent out to
the various tissues and organs, from which, as it
flows to them, they abstract the materials adapted
to their own peculiar form, composition, and vital
endowments. By the reception of these materials
the organs are rendered capable of performing the
vital actions which it is their office to accomplish.
And thus the processes of digestion, absorption,
secretion, nutrition, formation, reproduction, all the
processes included in the great organic circle, no
less than muscular action and nervous energy, depend
on receiving a due supply of arterial blood.
All these actions, like the faculties of the animal
life, cease totally and for ever in a few minutes after
the formation of this vital fluid has been stopped
by the suspension of respiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_480"></a>480. In the last place, the depurating process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
effected by respiration is necessary to prevent the
decomposition of the blood, and eventually that of
the body. The first step in the spontaneous decomposition
of animal matter consists in the loss
of a portion of its carbon, which, uniting with the
oxygen of the atmosphere, forms carbonic acid;
precisely the same thing that takes place in the
process of respiration. The bodies of all animals,
of worms, insects, fishes, birds, and mammalia, deoxidate
the air and load it with carbonic acid after
death, some of them nearly as much as during life;
and this before any visible marks of decomposition
can be traced. It is probable that the cause
which more immediately operates in preventing
the decomposition of the body is the abstraction
of a part of the carbon of the blood; that were
these carbonaceous particles allowed to accumulate,
they would produce a tendency to decomposition,
which would terminate in complete disorganization;
and consequently, that one main object of the
process of respiration is to afford blood not only
capable of nourishing and sustaining the organs,
but of maintaining their integrity, by removing
noxious matter, the presence of which would subvert
their composition and lead to their entire
decomposition.</p>

<p><a id="para_481"></a>481. The ultimate object of respiration, then,
is to prepare and to preserve in a state of purity a
fluid capable of affording to all the parts of the
body the materials necessary to maintain their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
vital endowments. By the exhalation of oxygen
and water, and the absorption of carbon, under
the agency of light, the plant elaborates such
a fluid from its nutritive sap, and out of this
elaborated sap forms terniary combinations, the
organic elements of all vegetable solids. By
the absorption of oxygen and azote, and the exhalation
of carbonic acid and water, probably
under the influence of electricity, conducted and
regulated by the nervous system, the animal
elaborates such a fluid from its aliment, and
out of this elaborated fluid forms quaternary
combinations, albumen, and fibrin, the organic
elements of all animal solids.</p>

<p><a id="para_482"></a>482. Closely connected with the function of
respiration, is the power which all living beings
possess of resisting within a certain range the
influence of external temperature. The plant is
warmer than the surrounding air in winter, and
colder in summer. A thermometer placed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
bottom of a hole bored into the centre of a living
tree, precaution being taken to keep off as much
as possible all external influence either of heat
or cold, does not rise and fall according to the
changes of external temperature; but rises when
the external air is cold, and falls when it is
warm. Thus, in a cold day in spring, the wind
being north, at six o’clock in the evening, the temperature
of the external air being 47°, that of a
tree was 55°. On another cold day in the same
month, there being snow and hail, and the wind in
the north-east, at six o’clock in the evening, the
external temperature being 39°, that of the tree
was 45°. On the contrary, in one experiment,
when the temperature of the air was 57½°, that of
the tree was only 55°; and when the temperature
of the air was 62°, that of the tree was 56°.</p>

<p><a id="para_483"></a>483. These experiments afford an explanation
of circumstances familiar to common observation.
Every one has noticed that the snow which falls
on grass and trees melts rapidly, while that on
the adjoining gravel walks often remains a long
time unthawed. Moist dead sticks are constantly
found frozen hard in the same garden with tender
growing twigs, which are not in the least degree
affected by the frost. Every winter in our own
climate tender herbaceous plants resist degrees of
cold which freeze large bodies of water.</p>

<p><a id="para_484"></a>484. But the colder, and the warmer the climate,
the more strikingly does the plant exemplify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the power with which it is endowed of resisting
external temperature. In the northern parts of
America the temperature is often 50° below zero;
yet, though exposed to this intense degree of cold,
the spruce fir, the birch, the juniper, &amp;c. preserve
their vitality uninjured. From numerous experiments
which have been performed expressly with
a view to ascertain this point, it is found that a
plant which has been once frozen is invariably
dead when thawed. It is also proved by direct
experiment, that if the sap be removed from its
proper vessels, it freezes at 32°, the ordinary
freezing point. In the northern parts of America,
then, the plant must preserve in its living vessels
its sap from freezing, when exposed to a temperature
of 50° below zero; which sap out of these
vessels would congeal at the ordinary freezing
point; that is, the plant of this climate is endowed
with the power of resisting a degree of cold ranging
from the ordinary freezing point to 50° below zero;
a property which can be referred only to a vital
power, by the operation of which the plant generates
within itself a degree of heat sufficient to
counteract the external cold.</p>

<p><a id="para_485"></a>485. The opposite faculty of resisting the influence
of external heat is exemplified by the
trees and shrubs of tropical climates, often surrounded
by a temperature of 104°, which they resist
just as the plant of the northern clime resists the
intense degrees of cold to which it is exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p><a id="para_486"></a>486. That the plant is endowed with the power
of generating heat is demonstrated by the phenomena
which attend the performance of some of
its vital processes, such as those of germination
and flowering. During the germination of barley,
the thermometer was observed to rise in the course
of one night to 102°. The bulb of a thermometer
applied to the surface of the spadix of an arum
maculatum, indicated a temperature 7° higher
than that of the external air; but in an arum
cordifolium, at the Isle of France, a thermometer
placed in the centre of five spadixes stood at 111°;
and in the centre of twelve at 121°, though the
temperature of the external air was only 66°.</p>

<p><a id="para_487"></a>487. Animals indicate in a still more striking
degree the power of generating heat. The lower
the animal in the scale of organization, indeed,
the nearer it approaches to the plant in the comparative
feebleness of this function. The heat of
worms, insects, crustacea, mollusca, fishes, and
amphibia, is commonly only two or three degrees
above that of the medium in which they are immersed.
Absolutely colder than the higher animals,
they are at the same time incapable of resisting
any considerable changes in the temperature of the
surrounding medium, whether from heat to cold
or from cold to heat. The higher animals, on the
contrary, maintain their heat steadily at a fixed
point, or very nearly at a fixed point, however the
temperature of the surrounding medium may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
change. Hence animals are divided into two great
classes, the cold-blooded and the warm-blooded.
The temperature of the cold-blooded is lower than
that of the warm-blooded, and it varies with the
heat of the surrounding medium; the temperature
of the warm-blooded is higher than that of the
cold-blooded, and it remains nearly at the same
fixed point, however the heat of the surrounding
medium may change.</p>

<p><a id="para_488"></a>488. The temperature natural to the higher
animals differs somewhat according to their class.
The temperature of the bird is the highest, and is
pretty uniformly about 103° or 104°; that of the
mammiferous quadruped is 100 or 101°; that of
the human species is 97° or 98°.</p>

<p><a id="para_489"></a>489. The temperature of the animal body is
not precisely the same in every part of it. The
ball of the thermometer introduced within the
rectum of the dog stood at 100½; within the
substance of the liver at 100¾; within the right
ventricle of the heart at 101°, and within the
cavity of the stomach at 101°. In the brain of
the lamb it stood at 104°; in the rectum at 105°;
in the right ventricle of the heart, and in the
substance of the liver and of the lungs, at 106°;
and in the left ventricle of the heart at 107°.</p>

<p><a id="para_490"></a>490. The temperature natural to the human
body is 98°. When the human body is surrounded
by an atmosphere at the temperature of 30°, it must
have its heat rapidly extracted by the cold medium;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
yet the temperature of the body, however long it
remain exposed to such a degree of cold, does not
sink, but keeps steadily at its own standard. But
animals which inhabit the polar regions are often
exposed to a cold 40° below zero. The temperature
of Melville Island is so low during five
months of the year that mercury congeals, and
the temperature is sometimes 46° below zero;
yet the musk oxen, the rein deer, the white hares,
the polar foxes, and the white bears which abound
in it maintain their temperature steadily at their
own natural standard.</p>

<p><a id="para_491"></a>491. The power which the higher animal possesses
of resisting heat is still more remarkable
than its power of resisting cold. On taking rabbits
and guinea-pigs from the temperature of 50°, and
introducing them very rapidly to the temperature
of 90°; it was found that the animals acquired
only two or three degrees of heat. How different
the result when the cold-blooded animal is subjected
to the same experiment! The temperature
of the surrounding air being 45°, a thermometer
introduced into the stomach of a frog rose to 49°.
The frog being then put into an atmosphere made
warm by heated water, and allowed to stay there
twenty minutes, the thermometer on being now
introduced into the stomach rose to 64°.</p>

<p><a id="para_492"></a>492. But the human body may be actually
placed in a temperature of 60° above that of boiling
water, not only without sustaining the slightest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>jury,
but without having its own temperature raised
excepting by two or three degrees. The attention
of physiologists was first directed to this curious
fact by some remarkable circumstances related by
the servants of a baker at Rochefoucault, who were
in the habit of going into the heated ovens in order
to prepare them for the reception of the loaves. In
performing this service, the young women were
sometimes exposed to a temperature as high as 278°.
It was stated that they could endure this intense
heat for twelve minutes, without any material
inconvenience, provided they were careful not to
touch the surface of the oven. Subsequently Drs.
Fordyce, Blagden, and others, with a view to ascertain
the exact facts, entered a chamber, heated
to a temperature much above that of boiling water,
and some of the phenomena observed during these
experiments are highly curious.</p>

<p><a id="para_493"></a>493. In the first room entered by these experimentalists,
the highest thermometer varied from
132° to 130°; the lowest stood at 119°. Dr.
Fordyce having undressed in an adjoining cold
chamber, went into the heat of 119°; in half a
minute the water poured down in streams over his
whole body, so as to keep that part of the floor
where he stood constantly wet. Having remained
here fifteen minutes, he went into the heat of
130°; at this time the heat of his body was 100°,
and his pulse beat 126 times in a minute. While
Dr. Fordyce stood in this situation a Florence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
flask was brought in by his order, filled with water
heated to 100°, and a dry cloth with which he
wiped the surface of the flask quite dry; but it
immediately became wet again, and streams of
water poured down its sides, which continued till
the heat of the water within had risen to 122°,
when Dr. Fordyce went out of the room, after
having remained fifteen minutes in a heat of 130°:
just before he left the room his pulse made 129
beats in a minute; but the heat under his tongue
and in his hand did not exceed 100°.</p>

<p><a id="para_494"></a>494. In a subsequent experiment the chamber
was entered when the thermometer stood above
211°. The air heated to this degree, says Dr.
Blagden, felt unpleasantly hot; but was very
bearable. Our most uneasy feeling was a sense
of scorching in the face and legs; our legs particularly
suffered very much, by being exposed
more fully than any other part to the body of the
stove, heated red hot by the fire within. Our respiration
was not at all affected; it became neither
quick nor laborious; the only difference was a
want of that refreshing sensation which accompanies
a full inspiration of cool air. But the most
striking effects proceeded from our power of preserving
our natural temperature. Being now in a
situation in which our bodies bore a very different
relation to the surrounding atmosphere from that
to which we had been accustomed, every moment
presented a new phenomenon. Whenever we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
breathed on a thermometer, the quicksilver sank
several degrees. Every expiration, particularly if
made with any degree of violence, gave a very
pleasant impression of coolness to our nostrils,
scorched before by the hot air rushing against
them whenever we inspired. In the same manner
our now cold breath agreeably cooled our fingers
whenever it reached them. Upon touching my
side, it felt cold like a corpse; and yet the actual
heat of my body, tried under my tongue, and by
applying closely the thermometer to my skin, was
98°, about a degree higher than its ordinary temperature.
When the heat of the air began to
approach the highest degree which this apparatus
was capable of producing, our bodies in the room
prevented it from rising any higher; and when it
had been previously raised above that point, invariably
sunk it. Every experiment furnished proofs
of this. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander each found
that his single body was sufficient to sink the
quicksilver very fast, when the room was brought
nearly to its maximum of heat.</p>

<p><a id="para_495"></a>495. In a third series of experiments the temperature
of the chamber was raised to the 260th
degree. At this time, continues Dr. Blagden, I
went into the room, with the addition to my common
clothes of a pair of thick worsted stockings
drawn over my shoes, and reaching some way
above my knees. I also put on a pair of gloves,
and held a cloth constantly between my face and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the stove (necessary precautions against the scorching
of the red-hot iron). I remained eight minutes
in this situation, frequently walking about to all
the different parts of the room, but standing still
most of the time in the coolest spot near the lowest
thermometer. The air felt very hot, but by no
means so as to give pain. I had no doubt of being
able to bear a much greater heat; and all who
went into the room were of the same opinion. I
sweated, but not very profusely. For seven minutes
my breathing remained perfectly good; but after
that time, I began to feel an oppression in my
lungs, attended with a sense of anxiety; which
gradually increasing for the space of a minute, I
thought it most prudent to end the experiment.
My pulse, counted as soon as I came into the cool
air, for the uneasy feeling rendered me incapable
of examining it in the room, beat at the rate of
144 pulsations in a minute, which is more than
double its ordinary quickness. In the course of
this experiment, and others of the same kind by
several of the gentlemen present, some circumstances
occurred to us which had not been remarked
before. The heat, as might have been
expected, felt most intense when we were in
motion; and on the same principle, a blast of
the heated air from a pair of bellows was scarcely
to be borne: the sensation in both these cases
exactly resembled that felt in our nostrils on inspiration.
It was observed that our breath did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
not feel cool to our fingers unless held very near
the mouth; at a distance the cooling power of the
breath did not sufficiently compensate the effect
of putting the air in motion, especially when we
breathed with force.</p>

<p><a id="para_496"></a>496. On going undressed into the room, the
impression of the air was much more disagreeable
than before; but in five or six minutes, a profuse
sweat broke out, which instantly relieved me.
During all the experiments of this day, whenever
I tried the heat of my body, the thermometer
always came very nearly to the same point (the
ordinary standard), not even one degree of difference,
as in our former experiments.</p>

<p><a id="para_497"></a>497. To prove that there was no fallacy in the
degree of heat shown by the thermometer, but
that the air which we breathed was capable of
producing all the well-known effects of such heat
on inanimate matter, we put some eggs and a beef
steak upon a tin frame, placed near the standard
thermometer, and farther distant from the stove
than the wall. In about thirty minutes the eggs
were taken out roasted quite hard. In about
forty-seven minutes the steak was not only dressed,
but almost dry. Another beef steak was rather
overdone in thirty-three minutes. In the evening
when the heat was still greater, we blew upon a
third steak with the bellows, which produced a
visible change on its surface, and hastened its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
dressing; the greatest part of it was pretty well
done in thirteen minutes.</p>

<p><a id="para_498"></a>498. The human body, then, may be exposed to
a temperature 50° below zero, without having its
own heat appreciably diminished; it may be exposed
to a temperature 60° above that of boiling
water, without having its own heat increased beyond
two or three degrees; or, as appears from
experiments subsequently performed expressly to
ascertain this point, from three to five degrees.
In the former case, the body must generate a
degree of heat sufficient to compensate the great
quantity of caloric which is every moment abstracted
from it by the intensely-cold surrounding
medium. In the latter case it must generate a
degree of cold sufficient to counteract the great
quantity of caloric which is every moment communicated
to it by the intensely-hot surrounding
medium.</p>

<p><a id="para_499"></a>499. Powers so wonderful and so opposite appeared
to the physiologists of former times to be
involved in such profound mystery, that they did
not even attempt to investigate their nature, or
trace their mode of operation; but satisfied themselves
with referring them to some innate quality
of the body, and with considering them as essential
attributes of life. And difficulties connected with
the subject still remain, which the present state of
knowledge does not permit us wholly to surmount;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
but we are able at least to refer these powers to
their proper seat, and to trace some steps of the
processes by which they produce results so wonderful
and beautiful.</p>

<p><a id="para_500"></a>500. It is certain that whatever be the ultimate
physical processes by which the generation of heat
and the production of cold are effected in the
animal body, the phenomena are dependent on the
condition of life. No such phenomena take place
excepting in living bodies. This is illustrated in a
striking manner by a series of experiments performed
by Mr. Hunter. A part of the living
human body was immersed in water gradually
made warmer and warmer from 100° to 118°;
precisely the same part of the body, dead, was immersed
in the same water, and both parts, the
living and the dead, were continued in this heat
for some minutes. The dead part raised the thermometer
to 114°; the living part raised it to no
higher than 102¼°. On applying the thermometer
to the sides of the living part, the quicksilver immediately
fell from 118° to 104°; on applying it
close to the dead part, the thermometer did not
fall above a single degree; the living part actually
produced a cold space of water around it.
Hence in bathing in water, whether colder or
warmer than the heat of the body, the water soon
acquires the same temperature with that of the
body; and, consequently, in a large bath the
patient should move from place to place, and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
small one there should be a constant succession
of water of the intended heat.</p>

<p><a id="para_501"></a>501. A fresh, that is, a living egg was put into
cold water at about zero, frozen, and then allowed
to thaw. By this process its vitality was destroyed,
and consequently its power of resisting cold and
heat lost. This thawed egg was next put into a
cold mixture with an egg newly laid: the time
required for freezing the fresh egg was seven minutes
and a half longer than that required for
freezing the thawed egg.</p>

<p><a id="para_502"></a>502. A new-laid egg was put into a cold atmosphere
fluctuating between 17° and 15°; it took
about half an hour to freeze; but when thawed
and put into an atmosphere at 25° (10° warmer),
it froze in half the time.</p>

<p><a id="para_503"></a>503. A fresh egg and one that had been frozen
and thawed were put into a cold mixture at 15°;
the thawed one soon came to 32°, and began to
swell and congeal; the fresh one sunk to 29½, and
in twenty-five minutes after the dead one, it rose
to 32°, and began to swell and freeze.</p>

<p><a id="para_504"></a>504. The result of this experiment upon the
fresh egg was similar to that of analogous experiments
made upon the frog, eel, snail, &amp;c. where life
allowed the heat to be diminished 2° or 3° below
the freezing point, and then resisted all further
decrease; but the powers of life having been expended
by this exertion, the parts then froze like
any other dead animal matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p><a id="para_505"></a>505. The heat of the bird is increased somewhat
when it is prepared for incubation. Some
eggs were taken from under a sitting hen whose
temperature was 104°, at the time when the chick
was about three-parts formed. A hole was broken
in the shell and the bulb of a thermometer introduced;
the quicksilver rose to 99½°; but in some
eggs that were addled it was proved that their heat
was not so high by two degrees, so that the life of
the living egg assisted to support its own temperature.</p>

<p><a id="para_506"></a>506. These facts sufficiently show the dependence
of the faculty of generating heat and of
producing cold on the powers of life. But the
processes by which, under the agency and control
of the vital powers, these different results are
effected, are various, and even opposite.</p>

<p><a id="para_507"></a>507. The power of generating heat is connected
in the closest manner with the function of
respiration, and is directly dependent upon it.
The evidence of this is indubitable. For—</p>

<p><a id="para_508"></a>508. i. Respiration is combustion, and, like
ordinary combustion, is attended with the production
of heat. In ordinary combustion oxygen
disappears, and a new compound is formed, consisting
of oxygen combined with the combustible
matter; that is, an oxidized body is generated.
On burning a piece of iron wire in oxygen, the
oxygen disappears, and the iron increases in
weight. The oxygen combines with the iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
forming a new product, oxide of iron, and the
weight of this new substance is found on examination
to be exactly equal to the weight of the
wire originally employed, added to the quantity of
oxygen which has disappeared.</p>

<p><a id="para_509"></a>509. It is precisely the same in respiration.
In this process oxygen combines with combustible
matter, carbon: the oxygen disappears, and a new
body, carbonic acid, is generated.</p>

<p><a id="para_510"></a>510. ii. One phenomenon which invariably
accompanies the combination of oxygen with combustible
matter is the extrication of heat. Whenever
a substance passes from a rarer into a denser
state; when, for example, a gas is converted into
a liquid or solid, or when a liquid solidifies, heat
is evolved; because, according to the ordinary
theory of combustion, the denser substance has a
less capacity for caloric than the rarer, and consequently
in passing from a rare into a dense state,
a quantity of caloric previously combined or latent
within it is set free. The combined or latent
caloric contained in a body is termed its specific
caloric; the caloric which is evolved on its change
of state is named free or sensible caloric.</p>

<p><a id="para_511"></a>511. The combination of oxygen with carbon,
as in the combination of oxygen with combustible
matter in every other instance, must be attended
with the evolution of heat. Though the product of
the combustion, in the present case, be a gaseous
body, carbonic acid, still, according to the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
theory of combustion, carbonic acid has less specific
caloric, or less capacity for caloric, than
oxygen; and therefore in combining with carbon,
a portion of its specific caloric becomes free or
sensible, that is, heat is evolved. But whatever
theory of combustion be adopted, the fact is certain,
that whenever oxygen combines with carbon
to form carbonic acid, heat is evolved; not only in
the rapid union which takes place in ordinary combustion,
but also in the slow combination which
occurs in fermentation, putrefaction, and germination;
in the latter of which processes, as in the
malting of barley, the temperature rises as high as
10°. The union of oxygen with carbon in the lungs
during respiration must therefore necessarily produce
heat, just as it does in a charcoal fire, or in
any other natural process in which this combination
takes place.</p>

<p><a id="para_512"></a>512. iii. Numerous phenomena connected with
the animal body show that its temperature is in
strict proportion to the quantity of oxygen which
is consumed in respiration, and to the quantity of
carbonic acid which is formed by the union of
oxygen and carbon during the process.</p>

<p><a id="para_513"></a>513. In all animals whose respiratory organs
are so constructed, that the consumption of oxygen
and the consequent generation of carbonic acid
is minute in quantity, the production of heat is
proportionably small. It has been shown (337
<i lang="la">et seq.</i>), that in almost the entire class of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
invertebrata, the respiratory apparatus is comparatively
minute and imperfect; accordingly, in
these animals the power of generating heat is at
the minimum. In the fish, though the respiratory
apparatus be large, and though all the blood of the
body circulate through it (345 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), yet only a
small quantity of air is brought into contact with
the respiratory organ, merely the air contained in
water. In the reptile, though it possess a true and
proper lung, and respire air, yet only one half of
the blood of its body circulates through the comparatively
small, imperfectly divided, and simply
constructed air bag, which constitutes its respiratory
organ (<a href="#para_354">354</a>). Hence, the striking contrast
exhibited between the temperature of these cold-blooded
creatures and that of the mammiferous
quadruped, whose lung, comparatively large, and
composed of innumerable minute and closely-set
air vesicles (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Fig_CXXXV">CXXXV</a>.</span>), presents
to the air an immense extent of surface (<a href="#para_370">370</a>), and
the whole mass of whose blood incessantly traversing
this surface, comes at every point into
contact with the air (<a href="#para_399">399</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_514"></a>514. In the various tribes of warm-blooded
animals, the elevation and uniformity of the temperature
is strictly proportionate to the comparative
magnitude of the lungs; to the complexity of their
structure; to the minuteness and number of the air
vesicles; and, consequently, to the quantity of
oxygen consumed, and of carbonic acid generated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p><a id="para_515"></a>515. In all animals with red blood there is a
strict relation between the temperature of the body
and the lightness or depth of the colour of the
blood; invariably the deeper the colour, the higher
the temperature. Thus, the blood of the fish and
of the reptile is of a light, and that of the bird of
an intense red colour. It has been shown (229)
that the lightness or deepness of the colour of the
blood depends on the quantity of red particles
which it contains, and the chemical action between
the air and the blood is carried on chiefly through
the medium of the red particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_516"></a>516. Even in the same animal, the temperature
differs at different times, according to the
energy with which the process of respiration is
carried on. When the circulation of the blood is
sluggish and the respiration slow and feeble, the
quantity of oxygen consumed is small, and the
temperature low; when, on the contrary, the circulation
is rapid, and the respiration energetic,
the quantity of oxygen consumed is large, and the
temperature proportionably high. Whatever diminishes
the quantity of air that flows to the lungs,
and the quantity of blood that circulates through
them, diminishes the temperature. Malformation
of the heart, in consequence of which a quantity of
blood is sent to the system without passing through
the lungs, as in the individuals termed Ceruleans:
disease of the lungs, by which the access of air to
the air vesicles is obstructed, as in asthma, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
morbid states invariably attended with a diminution
of the temperature.</p>

<p><a id="para_517"></a>517. When a warm-blooded animal is placed
in an elevated temperature, its consumption of
oxygen is comparatively small; when it is placed
in a cold atmosphere, and the production of a large
quantity of heat is necessary to maintain its temperature
at its natural standard, its consumption
of oxygen is proportionably large; accordingly, it
is established by direct experiment that the same
animal consumes a much larger quantity of oxygen
in winter than in summer.</p>

<p><a id="para_518"></a>518. Due allowance being made for the difference
in their bulk, young animals consume less
oxygen than adults; and they have a less power
of generating heat. Different species of young
animals differ from each other in their power of
generating heat, and the closest relation is observable
between the difference in their power of
consuming oxygen and that of generating heat.
Puppies and kittens require so small a quantity of
oxygen for supporting life, that they may be wholly
deprived of this gas for twenty minutes, without
material injury, while adult animals of the same
species perish when deprived of it only for four
minutes. As long as these young creatures retain
the power of sustaining life for so protracted a
period without oxygen, they are wholly incapable
of maintaining their own temperature; on free
exposure to air, even in summer, the heat of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
body sinks rapidly, and if this exposure be continued
long, they perish of cold. In like manner,
young sparrows and other birds which are naked
when hatched, consume little oxygen, and are incapable
of maintaining their temperature; but can
support life when deprived of oxygen much longer
than adult birds of the same species; while young
partridges which are able to retain their own temperature
at the period of quitting the shell, die
when deprived of oxygen as rapidly as the adult
bird.</p>

<p><a id="para_519"></a>519. The state of hybernation illustrates in the
same striking manner the relation between respiration
and the generation of heat. One of the
most remarkable phenomena connected with this
curious state, is the reduction, sometimes even the
apparent suspension, of respiration; and in all
cases of hybernation, the respiratory function is
performed in a feeble manner, and only at distant
intervals. Exactly in proportion to the diminution
of the respiration, is the reduction of the power of
generating heat; so that when the state of hybernation
is established, the temperature of the external
parts of the body sinks nearly to that of the
surrounding medium; while the internal parts,
the blood, and the vital organs are only a degree
or two higher. In experiments made to reduce an
hybernating animal to a torpid state by cold artificially
produced, De Saissy found that he could
not bring on the state of hybernation by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
reduction of temperature alone, without also constraining
the respiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_520"></a>520. These and other analogous facts abundantly
establish the relation between the function
of respiration and that of calorification, and lead
to the general conclusion that the generation of
animal heat is in the direct ratio of the quantity of
air and blood which are brought into contact, and
which act on each other in a given time. Yet an
attempt has recently been made by an ingenious
physiologist<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> to disturb this induction, and to
show that the production of animal heat is not in
the direct ratio of the quantity of oxygen inhaled,
but in the inverse ratio of the quantity of blood
exposed to this principle. This position is maintained
on the following grounds:—</p>

<p><a id="para_521"></a>521. Inspiration favours the flow of blood to
the lungs; expiration retards it: consequently, if
from any causes the inspirations preponderate in
number and proportion over the expirations, a
greater quantity of blood than usual will be accumulated
in the lungs. There are conditions of the
system in which this preponderance of the inspirations
actually takes place; when the mind is
under the influence of certain emotions, for example,
as when it is depressed by anxiety and fear.
In this state the inspirations are more frequent</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>
<p>and more complete than the expirations; it is a
state of continual sighing. In like manner, in
certain diseases, such as asthma, the inspirations
greatly preponderate both in frequency and energy
over the expirations. In such conditions of the
system the blood accumulates in preternatural
quantity in all the internal organs; but more
especially in the lungs; and two consequences
follow: first, there is a remarkable diminution in
the energy of all the vital actions; and secondly
there is a proportionate diminution in the production
of animal heat.</p>

<p><a id="para_522"></a>522. On the contrary, as it is the effect of
inspiration to facilitate the motion of the blood
through the lungs, so it is the effect of expiration
to retard it; hence, when the expirations preponderate
the opposite state of the system is induced;
all the vital actions are performed with increased
energy; the heart beats with unusual vigor; the
pulse becomes quick and strong; a larger quantity
of blood is determined to the surface of the
body, and this excited state of the system is always
attended with an augmentation of the temperature.</p>

<p><a id="para_523"></a>523. As in the first state there is a greater and
in the second a smaller quantity of blood than
natural contained in the lungs, the inference deduced
by Dr. Holland is, that the production of
animal heat is in the inverse ratio of the quantity
of blood exposed to oxygen. But this inference is
neither logical nor sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p><a id="para_524"></a>524. If, as a comparison of all the phenomena
of respiration exhibited throughout the entire range
of the animal kingdom, shows the production of
animal heat to be in the direct ratio of the quantities
of air and blood which are brought into contact,
and which re-act on each other, every phenomenon
of respiration must be in harmony with this law,
and, accordingly, when really understood, it is
found to be so.</p>

<p><a id="para_525"></a>525. Inspiration, by the dilatation of the thorax,
and consequently of the lungs incident to that
action, is favorable to the flow of blood to the lungs.
But it is only a certain degree of dilatation of the
lungs that is favorable to the flow of blood through
them (407 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>). If the dilatation be carried
beyond a certain point, the quantity of blood transmitted
through the pulmonary tissue is diminished
(<a href="#para_406">406</a>); if the dilatation be carried farther, the
transmission of the blood may be wholly stopped
(<a href="#para_417">417</a>). The quantity of the blood which flows to
the lungs, and the quantity which circulates
through them, are not then identical. So large a
quantity may flow to them as to impede or retard or
wholly stop the pulmonary circulation. In proportion
to the accumulation of blood in the lung
must necessarily be the distension of the pulmonary
tissue; in that proportion the lung must be
approximated to its condition in the experiment in
which it was distended with water (<a href="#para_417">417</a>), when it
did not transmit a single particle of blood. Further,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
in proportion to the preternatural distension of
the pulmonary tissue with blood must be the
exclusion of air from the air vesicles for the lungs
can contain only a certain quantity of blood and
air (418.3), so that the blood can preponderate
only by the exclusion of the air.</p>

<p><a id="para_526"></a>526. In those states of the system, then, in
which the preponderance of the inspirations induces
a preternatural accumulation of blood in the lungs,
the production of animal heat is diminished for a
two-fold reason; first, because the distension of
the pulmonary tissue with blood retards the pulmonary
circulation, and proportionally lessens the
quantity of blood which is brought into contact
with the air; and, secondly, because the distended
blood-vessels compress the air vesicles, and so
diminish the quantity of air which is brought into
contact with the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_527"></a>527. It follows that the diminution of temperature
which takes place in this condition of the
system is not because the production of animal
heat is in the inverse ratio of the quantity of blood
which is exposed to oxygen; but because from a
two-fold operation there is a diminution of the
quantity of blood and of oxygen which are brought
into contact.</p>

<p><a id="para_528"></a>528. The reason is equally obvious why there
is an increase of the temperature in those conditions
of the system in which the expirations
preponderate over the inspirations. Expiration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
it is true, somewhat retards the circulation of the
blood through the lungs, but the preponderance of
this respiratory action does not raise the temperature
by the retardation of the flow of blood through
the lungs, and the consequent diminution of the
quantity transmitted in a given time; for though
expiration somewhat retards the circulation of the
blood through the branches of the pulmonary
artery, it promotes its circulation through the
branches of the pulmonary veins (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a>.</span> 10).
It is indeed by the action of expiration that the
aërated blood is transmitted from the lungs to the
left heart to be sent out renovated to the system.
Expiration has no influence whatever over the
aëration of the blood. Before the action of expiration
takes place, the blood is already aërated.
The office of expiration is to remove from the
system the air which has served for respiration,
and to transmit to the system the blood which has
been subjected to respiration. Consequently, in
those states of the system in which the expirations
preponderate, the temperature is increased, not
because the expiratory actions, by lessening the
quantity of blood in the lungs, diminish the quantity
exposed to oxygen, but because they transmit
to the system oxygenated blood as rapidly as it is
formed, that is, blood which either produces animal
heat in the act of its formation, or which generates
it as it flows through the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p><a id="para_529"></a>529. These conditions establish the conclusion
deduced, as has been stated, from the comparison
of the phenomena of respiration exhibited throughout
the entire range of the animal kingdom. But
if the production of animal heat be really the
result of combustion, if that combustion take place
in the lung, and if the lung be thus the focus
whence the heat radiates to every other part of
the body, why is not the heat of this organ and of
the parts in its immediate neighbourhood higher
than the temperature of the rest of the body?
Some of the internal organs are indeed a degree or
two hotter than the general mass of the circulating
blood (<a href="#para_469">469</a>), and among these the lung is admitted
to rank perhaps the very highest. But
how can a quantity of caloric sufficient to maintain
the heat of the body in a temperature of forty
degrees below zero radiate from an organ the temperature
of which is only two or three degrees
above that of the body itself? It is estimated
that, in every minute, during the calm respiration
of a healthy man of ordinary stature, 26·6 cubic
inches of carbonic acid, at the temperature of
50° Fahr. are emitted, and that an equal volume of
oxygen is withdrawn from the atmosphere. From
these data it is calculated that, in an interval of
twenty-four hours, not less than eleven ounces of
carbon are consumed. Why is the lung, the seat
of this combustion, not only not greatly warmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
than any other organ; but why is it not even consumed
by the fire which is thus incessantly burning
within it?</p>

<p><a id="para_530"></a>530. It has been shown (468 and 469) that when
the carbon of the blood unites in the lung with the
oxygen of the air, the nature of the blood, in consequence
of the abstraction of carbon, undergoes
an essential change, passing from venous into
arterial. By an elaborate series of experiments,
conducted with extraordinary care and skill, it
would appear that arterial has a greater capacity
for caloric than venous blood, in the proportion of
114·5 to 100. In consequence of this difference
in the constitution of the two kinds of blood, the
heat generated in the lung by the combustion of
carbon, instead of being evolved or becoming sensible
(510. ii.), and so raising the temperature of
the organ, goes to satisfy the increased capacity for
caloric of arterial blood, is spent, not in rendering
the fluid sensibly warmer, but in augmenting
its specific caloric (510. ii.). Arterial blood is not
increased in temperature,<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> but with its absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
quantity of caloric augmented, flows from the
lung to the left heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 10), and thence to
the system (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXL">CXL</a></span>. 6). In the system, in every
organ, at every point of the component tissue of
every organ and at every moment of time, the
blood repasses from the arterial to the venous
state: by this transition its capacity for heat is
diminished; the venous cannot retain in it the
same quantity of caloric as the arterial blood, consequently
a portion of caloric is extricated; that
which was latent becomes sensible, and caloric
being set free the temperature is raised. In this
process the lung is not burnt, it is only rendered
just sensibly warmer than any other part of the
body, though it be the organ by which the whole
mass of blood receives its caloric, because it is
only in the capillary part of the systemic circulation,
when the arterial blood again passes into the
venous state, that the caloric acquired is liberated.
In this manner, gently, steadily, uninterruptedly,
an abundant, unceasing, and equable current of
heat is distributed to every part and particle of the
system.</p>

<p><a id="para_531"></a>531. Such is the celebrated theory of animal
heat suggested by Dr. Crawford, of which it has
been justly said, that it affords one of the most
beautiful specimens of the application of physical
and chemical reasoning to the animal economy
that has ever been presented to the world.</p>

<p><a id="para_532"></a>532. The main position on which this theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
rests—that arterial possesses a greater capacity
for caloric than venous blood—professes to be
founded on experiments which, though of a delicate
and complex nature, are nevertheless uniform
and decisive in their results. In consequence of
their extreme interest and importance, these experiments
have been subjected, by different physiologists,
to rigid examination, with a somewhat
conflicting result. The greater number of experimentalists
maintain that Crawford’s experiments
are correct in all the essential points, and that the
objections which have been urged against them
do not really affect them; while others are of opinion
that, even although it must, upon the whole,
be admitted that the specific heat of arterial is
greater than that of venous blood; yet that the
excess is so small as to be inadequate to account
for the effects attributed to it. Dr. Davy’s experiments,
which of all that have been instituted are
generally conceived to be the most unfavourable to
the theory of Crawford, do not afford uniform results.
Three experiments out of four indicate a
greater capacity in arterial than in venous blood;
in those in which the experimentalist himself
places the most confidence, in the relative proportion
of 913 to 903; while, according to Crawford,
the relative proportion is 114·5 to 100.</p>

<p><a id="para_533"></a>533. But when this subject is closely considered,
the discrepancy in question turns out to be
of no real consequence. There is a modification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of the theory, which removes every difficulty, and
dispenses with the necessity of any regard whatever
to the point in dispute.</p>

<p><a id="para_534"></a>534. It has been shown (444 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), that during
the process of respiration more oxygen disappears
than is accounted for by the carbonic acid that is
generated; that this excess of oxygen is absorbed
by the blood; and that in the lung the oxygen
merely enters into a state of loose combination
with the blood, the union being intimate and complete
only in the system. The complete chemical
combination of the oxygen with the carbon takes
place, then, not in the lungs, but in the capillary
arteries of the system; consequently it is only
while flowing in capillary arteries that carbonic
acid is formed; that is, it is only in these vessels
that the arterial combustion takes place: of
course, therefore, it is only in these vessels that
heat is extricated, and only from them that it can
be communicated to the adjacent parts. According
to this view, wherever there is a capillary
artery, the combustion of carbon incessantly goes
on, and there caloric is as incessantly set free;
but since there is not a point of any tissue, in which
there are not capillary arteries, there is not a point
from which caloric does not radiate. As soon as
formed, carbonic acid passes from the capillary
arteries into the capillary veins; by the veins it is
transmitted to the lungs; and by the lungs it is expelled
from the system. The real operations car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>ried
on in the lungs, then, are the transmission of
oxygen and the extrication of carbonic acid; but
this organ is not the seat of the essential and ultimate
part of the function; it is merely the portal
through which the elements employed in the process
have their entrance and exit. Thus the question
concerning the greater capacity of arterial
blood for caloric is of no importance whatever:
the phenomena may be equally accounted for,
whatever be, in this respect, the constitution of the
blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_535"></a>535. The result of the whole is, the complete
establishment of the fact, that the production of
heat in the animal body is a chemical operation,
dependent on the combination of oxygen with carbon
in the capillary arteries of the system; that
is, it is the result of the burning of charcoal at
every point of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_536"></a>536. The agent which maintains and regulates
this internal fire is the nervous system. There is,
indeed, reason to suppose that the nervous system,
in some mode or other, contributes to the actual
production of animal heat. It is established by
direct experiment, that the quantity of carbonic
acid formed in the system is inadequate to the
supply of the caloric expended by it; that in a
given time more heat is abstracted from the body
by the surrounding medium, than can be accounted
for by the consumption of the amount of carbonic
acid thrown off by the lungs during the same inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>val.
There is evidence that the source of this
additional heat is the nervous system.</p>

<p><a id="para_537"></a>537. The influence exerted by the nervous
system over the production of animal heat, is
demonstrated by the fact, established by numerous
observations and experiments, that whatever
weakens the nervous power, proportionally
diminishes the capacity of producing heat.
For,</p>

<p>1. The destruction of a portion of the spinal cord
diminishes the temperature of an animal without,
as far as is ascertained, the disturbance of any other
function.</p>

<p>2. The privation of the heart and blood-vessels of
the nervous influence, as by decapitation, though
the passage of the blood through the lungs and its
ordinary change from the venous to the arterial
state be maintained by artificial respiration, greatly
diminishes, if it do not altogether suspend, the
generation of animal heat.</p>

<p>3. The abolition of sensibility by the administration
of a narcotic poison, artificial respiration being
maintained, as effectually disturbs the generation of
animal heat as decapitation; while the power of
generating heat is restored, in the exact proportion
to the return of the sensibility by the cessation of
the action of the poison.</p>

<p>4. The temperature of an organ is found, by
direct experiment, to be diminished by the division
of the nerves that supply it with nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
influence. The nerves that supply the horn were
divided on one side of the body in a young deer;
the other horn was left entire. The temperature
of the horn—the nerves of which had been divided—was
found, after some hours, to be considerably
diminished, and it continued diminished
for several days; at length its temperature was
restored. On examining the horn about ten days
after the operation had been performed, the divided
nerves were found to be connected by a newly-formed
substance; thus apparently accounting
for the loss of temperature in the first instance,
and for its subsequent restoration.</p>

<p><a id="para_538"></a>538. But although these and other analogous
facts prove, beyond all question, the important
influence of the nervous system over the development
of animal heat, yet the mode in which that
influence operates is not ascertained. Its action
may be either direct or indirect. The nerves may
possess some specific power of generating heat,—extricating
it immediately from the blood by a
process analogous to secretion,—or they may
evolve it indirectly by other operations, as by
some of the processes of nutrition. Each hypothesis
is maintained by able physiologists; but
the balance of evidence (as will appear hereafter)
is greatly in favour of the opinion that the influence
of the nervous system over this process is
altogether indirect. A beautiful illustration of
this is afforded in the following operation, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
is going on, without ceasing, every instant during
life.</p>

<p><a id="para_539"></a>539. The skin which forms the external
covering of the body is composed essentially of
gelatin. No gelatin is contained in the blood;
but the albumen of the blood is capable of being
converted into gelatin by the addition of oxygen.
Albumen is received by the capillary artery of the
skin; the blood, of which albumen forms so important
a constituent, contains a quantity of
oxygen which it receives at the moment of inspiration,
and which it retains in a state of loose
combination (470 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>). Under the influence
probably of the organic nerve, the capillary artery
chemically combines a portion of the free oxygen
with the albumen of the blood, and gelatin is the
result. In this process the albumen gives off
carbon; the blood affords oxygen; the two
elements unite; carbonic acid is formed; and,
as in every other instance in which carbonic
acid is formed, heat is evolved. In this manner a
fire is kindled, and is kept constantly burning,
where it is most needed to counteract the influence
of external cold, at the external surface of
the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_540"></a>540. Such are the main points which have
been established in relation to the production and
distribution of animal heat. But it has been
shown that the living body is capable of bearing
without injury a temperature by which it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
rapidly consumed when deprived of life. By what
means does the vital power enable the body to
resist the influence of such intense degrees of
heat?</p>

<p><a id="para_541"></a>541. Two circumstances are observable when
the body is placed in a temperature greatly higher
than its own. First, it can endure such a temperature
only in the medium of air. Air can
easily be borne at the temperature of 260°;
aqueous vapour at the temperature of 130° few
Europeans are capable of enduring longer than
twelve minutes; the peasants of Finland appear
to be able to sustain it, for the space of half an
hour, as high as 167°; but the hottest liquid
water-bath which any one seems to have been able
to bear for the space of ten minutes, is the hottest
spring at Barêges, the temperature of which is
113°. But in heated air the quantity of heat in
actual contact with the body is much less than in
the other media; because in proportion as the air
is heated it is expanded, and in proportion as it is
expanded the particles are diminished that come
into contact with the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_542"></a>542. In the second place, the afflux of the
colder fluids from the central parts of the system
to the surface may for a time exert some influence
in keeping down the temperature of the body.
But above all this, in the third place, a two-fold
provision is made in the body itself for the reduction
of its temperature when exposed to in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>tense
degrees of heat; by the one, the power with
which it is endowed of producing heat is diminished;
by the other, cold is positively generated.</p>

<p><a id="para_543"></a>543. It has been shown (<a href="#para_517">517</a>) that in proportion
to the elevation of the temperature to
which the body is exposed the blood becomes less
venalized, and in the proportion in which the
blood retains its arterial character the consumption
of oxygen is diminished. Venous blood contains
an excess of carbon, arterial blood an excess of
oxygen. Consequently in proportion as the blood
retains its arterial character it affords less carbon
for the combination of oxygen, that is less inflammable
matter. At an elevated temperature therefore
there must, of necessity, be a diminished production
of heat within the body, since the blood
contains a diminished quantity of combustible
material.</p>

<p><a id="para_544"></a>544. Moreover, in proportion to the elevation
of the temperature to which the body is
exposed, evaporation takes place from the entire
surface of the pulmonary vesicles. No experiments
have been performed which enable the physiologist
to ascertain precisely the quantity of
vapour exhaled from the lungs in a given time,
when the body is exposed to a given degree of
heat; but both observation and experiment show
that it is very great. The blood pours out
upon the whole surface of the air vesicles a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
quantity of moisture in the form of water: by
the surrounding air this water is converted into
vapour: by the conversion of a fluid from the
state of a liquid into that of vapour caloric is
absorbed: by the absorption of caloric cold is
generated, and that to such a degree that fluids
exposed to the influence of evaporation may be
frozen in the intensest heat of summer. The
very process by which art, aided by science,
affords to the inhabitants of warm climates the
luxury of ice, is that by which nature generates
cold in the human lungs when the body is exposed
to a temperature above its own. Not only, then,
is the lung the instrument by which the body
acquires the power of evolving heat in greater or
less quantity in proportion to the demands of the
system, but this very same organ, under a change
of circumstances, produces the directly contrary
effect, and actually generates cold.</p>

<p><a id="para_545"></a>545. In the process of producing cold the
skin is a powerful auxiliary to the lungs. More
fluid is, indeed, evaporated from the surface of the
skin in the form of perspiration, than from the
lungs in the form of vapour; the cutaneous, like
the pulmonary evaporation, increases in the ratio
of the temperature, and both co-operate in abstracting
the excess of caloric.</p>

<p><a id="para_546"></a>546. Finally, in proportion to the elevation of
the temperature is the acceleration of the circulation;
the pulse is augmented in power, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
doubled or trebled in frequency (<a href="#para_495">495</a>); but in
proportion to the rapidity of the circulation is
the increase of the quantity of evaporable matter
which is transmitted to the evaporating surfaces.</p>

<p><a id="para_547"></a>547. From the whole it appears that by
the combination of carbon and oxygen provision
is made for the production of the greatest quantity
of caloric that can at any time be required for the
wants of the system; that when a decreased evolution
of heat is necessary a smaller quantity of
carbon and oxygen is brought into union, and
that when, from exposure to intense degrees of
heat, it is requisite for the maintenance of the
temperature of the body at its own standard, that
it should actually generate cold, it accomplishes
this object by the evaporation of water.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<small>OF THE FUNCTION OF DIGESTION.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Process of Assimilation in the plant; in the animal—Digestive

a lower and a higher; the former preparatory to the

<p><a id="para_548"></a>548. Digestion is the function by which the
aliment is converted into nutriment. No food
can nourish until it be converted into a fluid analogous
in chemical composition to that of the body
by which it is assimilated. The conversion of
the crude aliment into such a fluid is effected by
a vital power peculiar to living beings, by which
they subvert the constitution of other organized
bodies, and cause them to assume their own.
They accomplish this change by the agency of
certain secretions which they elaborate in their
own organs, and which they add to the substances
they receive as aliment. By the action of these
secretions, the chemical composition of the ali<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>ment
is brought into a close affinity to that of the
body which it nourishes.</p>

<p><a id="para_549"></a>549. This change in the chemical composition
of the aliment, by means of fluids secreted by the
living bodies which receive it, is manifest in the
plant as well as in the animal. The sap, as it
issues from the root, is a colourless and limpid
fluid; it has a specific gravity a little greater than
that of water; it has a sweetish taste; it contains
an acid which is sometimes free, and is either the
carbonic or the acetic; but more commonly it is
combined with lime or potass. To this crude
sap, in this the first stage of its formation, vegetable
secretions, sugar and mucus, assimilative
substances, are superadded, probably by the fibres
of the root.</p>

<p><a id="para_550"></a>550. As the sap ascends in the stalk, a greater
quantity and a greater number of these vegetable
secretions are poured into it. In the ratio of its
elevation it acquires sugar, mucus, albumen, and
an azotized substance analogous to gluten. By
the admixture of these assimilative secretions,
the crude sap is progressively assimilated nearer
and nearer to the chemical composition of the
proper nutritive fluid of the plant. Thus prepared,
the sap passes to the leaf, in the upper
surface of which it undergoes a process analogous
to that of digestion in the animal (<a href="#para_315">315</a>), and is
converted into proper nutrient matter.</p>

<p><a id="para_551"></a>551. The plant can only take up, by absorp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>tion,
liquid food; it never receives solid substances
as aliment: it therefore needs no apparatus
for the division, solution, and fluidification
of its food; its sole work of assimilation consists
in changing the innate affinities of liquid aliment.
But animals which live on vegetable and animal
substances have to modify, by their digestive
juices, the affinities of organic solids: hence assimilation
in the animal must necessarily be a more
complex operation than it is in the plant.</p>

<p><a id="para_552"></a>552. Fixed immovably to the soil by its roots,
the nutritive apparatus of the plant is always in
contact with its food, which is slowly but unceasingly
absorbed according to the wants of
its system. But the animal endowed with the
faculty of locomotion receives its aliment into the
interior of its body, that it may transport its food
along with it in all its changes of place; and
that, as in the plant, its food may be always in
contact with its nutritive apparatus. The interior
nutrition of the animal and the convergence of its
nutritive apparatus to the centre of its system,
and the exterior nutrition of the plant and the
divergence of its nutritive apparatus to the peripheral
extremity of its body, are differences in
their mode of nutrition, connected with essential
differences in the mode of life peculiar to the two
beings.</p>

<p><a id="para_553"></a>553. Plant-like animals have a plant-like
mode of nutrition. The transition from the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
class to the other is so gradual as to be almost insensible.
Fixed to the same spot in the ocean as
the tree to the land, the nutritive surface of the
poriferous animal is always in contact with the
water, as the soil is with the external surface of
the plant. The cellular substance of which the
bag of the poriferous animal is composed is permeated
in all directions by ramifying and anastomosing
canals, which, beginning by minute pores
placed on the external surface, terminate in larger
orifices, termed vents, which are fecal openings.
These internal canals are incessantly traversed by
streams of water, which enter through the minute,
and are discharged through the larger orifices.
By these currents the nutrient matter contained
in the water is conveyed to every part of the body,
and the streams that issue from the fecal orifices
abound with minute flocculent particles, the residue
of the digested matter. No separate part of
the body is appropriated to the function of digestion
any more than in the plant; there is
merely a general absorbent surface; the water is
to this animal what the soil is to the plant; its
whole surface is a root; every point of that surface
is constantly in contact with its food, and
every point is absorbent.</p>

<p><a id="para_554"></a>554. In the class above the porifera, the margins
of the superficial pores are merely lengthened
out into minute sacs, irritable and sentient, surrounded
with vibratile cilia (<a href="#para_342">342</a>). These sacs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
which are termed polypi, are so many little stomachs,
which select, seize, and digest the food
brought to them in the currents of water created
by the action of the cilia (<a href="#para_344">344</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_555"></a>555. The fresh-water polype, the little hydra
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVIII">CXLVIII</a>.</span> 1), is one of these minute sacs detached
and endowed with the power of locomotion
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVIII">CXLVIII</a>.</span> 5), a sentient, self-moving digestive
bag. Capable of swallowing animals many times
its own size, as the red-blooded worm, this little
creature stretches its whole body like a thin
elastic membrane over its prey, so as completely
to alter its own shape, and the membranous sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>stance
of which it is composed becoming transparent
by the distention, allows the subsequent
process to be distinctly seen. The red fluid of
the worm, as the process of digestion advances, is
slowly diffused over every part of the internal surface
of the polype. The whole internal surface of
this minute self-moving bag is digestive; a true
and proper stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLVIII">CXLVIII</a>.</span> 6). By dexterous
manipulation, this internal surface may be
rendered external, and the animal turned completely
inside out. Then the external begins to
perform the office of the internal surface, carrying
on the function of digestion, just as well as that
which was primitively formed for it; while the
originally digestive becomes the generative surface,
for the creature buds from this surface, now
the outer one; a striking and instructive illustration
of the analogy between the external covering
of the animal body or the skin, and its internal
lining, or the mucous surface.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>Group of Monades; the dark spots in the interior of their
bodies representing their digestive sacs.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_556"></a>556. In the monades (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIX">CXLIX</a>.</span>), and in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the lower animalcules, the digestive apparatus,
instead of forming the entire internal surface of
the body, consists of numerous sacs, which constitute
so many separate stomachs, whence the
name of the class, <i>polygastrica</i>. When empty,
or when filled with water, these digestive
sacs cannot be distinguished from the common
cellular tissue of the body; but on feeding the
animals with coloured organic matter, minutely
diffused in water, the coloured particles readily
enter the digestive sacs, and render apparent their
form and arrangement. In the minutest animal
hitherto appreciable, the monas termo, the 2000th
part of a line in diameter, four rounded sacs have
been seen filled with coloured particles (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXLIX">CXLIX</a>.</span>).
Each of these sacs, about the 6000th part of a
line in diameter, opens by a narrow neck into a
funnel-shaped mouth, surrounded with a single
row of long vibratite cilia, by the action of which
the floating organic particles are brought within
the reach of the mouth. In general, even in this
class, an alimentary canal traverses the whole
extent of the body, into which all the different
stomachs open. Sometimes numerous branches
proceed from the main trunks of the alimentary
canal, bearing the nutritive matter to the different
parts of the body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CL">CL</a>.</span> 2). Often, in order to
extend the digestive surface, the alimentary canal
is produced, forming rounded enlargements called
cœcal appendages, all of which act as so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
additional stomachs (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLI">CLI</a>.</span> 3). In some individuals,
observed under favourable circumstances,
nearly 200 of these cœcal stomachs, filled with
coloured matter, have been counted, and there may
have been many more unseen, because empty and
collapsed. In the lowest tribes of this class there
is but one orifice to the alimentary canal, the
oral; the food entering, and the fecal matter
passing out of the system by the same aperture;
but in the higher orders there is both an oral and
an anal orifice, and the mouth and the anus are
placed at opposite extremities of the body, as in
the higher animals.</p>

<p><a id="para_557"></a>557. Up to this point in the animal series the
digestive sacs and the alimentary canal are merely
cavities formed in the common cellular tissue of
the body, without any lining membrane, without
teeth, or without any instruments for dividing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
and preparing the aliment, and without a single
gland, as far as has been ascertained, to assist the
digestive process. All the assimilative functions,
the respiratory as well as the digestive, appear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
be performed by this single surface. But in the
ascending scale not only is an apparatus appropriated
to digestion, perfectly distinct from that
assigned to respiration, but even the stomach
and the alimentary canal are separate organs, distinguished
from each other, both in structure and
function. Still higher in the scale new organs are
successively added, as the process becomes more
complex and refined, in order to assist the main
operations carried on in particular parts of the apparatus;
and as that apparatus approaches its highest
degree of perfection, not only do the several parts
of which it is composed increase in number and
complexity, but each part becomes more and more
isolated from the rest, a specific office being
assigned to each in the division of labour that is
made. Viewing, however, the digestive apparatus
as a whole, whether simple or complex, whether
consisting of a single uninterrupted surface, or
divided into many separate portions, its nature is
universally and invariably the same, and from the
monad to man is endowed with analogous vital
energies.</p>

<p><a id="para_558"></a>558. Comparative anatomy, which has succeeded
in tracing through the different classes,
orders, genera, and countless tribes of animals, the
modifications in form and structure of the digestive
apparatus, has shown that those modifications
are invariably in strict adaptation to the kind of
food on which the apparatus is destined to act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
and to the extent of the elaboration requisite to
convert crude aliment into proper animal substance.
To trace this adaptation through the
rising and ever-varying series, is a most interesting
and instructive study, not only exhibiting, in
the very organs that elaborate its food, the physical
and even the mental qualities assigned by
the hand of nature to each individual, but oftentimes
shedding a clear and bright light on the
complex structures of the highest and most perfect
organization. Striking and beautiful illustrations
are afforded by these investigations of the
principle formerly insisted on (vol. i. chap. i.
p. 28, 3), that the communication of the higher
faculties exalts the apparatus even of the very
lowest processes, that the latter may work in harmony
with the former. In conformity with this
principle, as the nobler endowments exalt the
animal in the scale of organization, so even its
very digestive apparatus becomes extended, isolated,
complex and refined.</p>

<p><a id="para_559"></a>559. The highest and most perfect form of
the digestive apparatus is that which is disposed
in a series of chambers in free communication
with each other. In these chambers the food
undergoes a succession of changes, by which it is
progressively assimilated to the nature of animal
substance. This assimilation, however, is never
effected by the sole agency of the chambers themselves;
it is accomplished, to a great extent, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the influence of special organs placed in the
neighbourhood of the digestive chambers. In the
lowest animal there is but one substance and
one surface for every function; in the highest,
even for the performance of the lowest function,
there is the combination of many substances which
are arranged in complex modes.</p>

<p><a id="para_560"></a>560. In man, the digestive chambers are five;
the auxiliary organs are many.</p>

<p>The first of these chambers is the cavity called
the mouth; the second is the bag termed the
pharynx; the pharynx communicates by the
esophagus with the third chamber, the stomach;
the fourth chamber consists of the convoluted
tubes named the small intestines, and the fifth
consists of the larger tubes, denominated the
large intestines. The assistant organs are, first,
numerous appendages to the mouth, namely, the
tongue, the teeth, the salivary glands, and the
muscles that work the jaws; and, secondly, certain
appendages to the small intestines, namely,
the pancreas, the liver, the mesenteric glands, and
the lacteal vessels.</p>

<p><a id="para_561"></a>561. By the mouth the food is softened and
reduced to a pulp; by the tongue, materially aided
by the soft palate, this pulp, when duly prepared,
is transmitted to the pharynx; received by the
pharynx, it is sent on to the esophagus; by the
esophagus, it is conveyed to the stomach; in the
stomach, it is converted into a peculiar substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
called chyme; the chyme, passing from the stomach
into the first portion of the small intestines,
is there converted into the substance called chyle;
the chyle, carried slowly along the remaining portion
of the small intestines, is successively absorbed
by the lacteals; by the lacteals, it is conveyed
through the mesenteric glands to the thoracic duct,
and by the thoracic duct it is poured into the
venous blood close to the heart. By the large
intestines the refuse matter is conveyed out of the
system.</p>

<p><a id="para_562"></a>562. The function of digestion consists, then,
of the following processes:—</p>

<p>1. Prehension. 2. Mastication. 3. Insalivation.
4. Deglutition. 5. Chymification. 6. Chylification.
7. Absorption. 8. Fecation.</p>

<p><a id="para_563"></a>563. Prehension is the reception of the aliment;
mastication is the mechanical comminution
of it; insalivation is the admixture of it with certain
juices poured into the mouth; deglutition is
the transmission of it, when duly moistened and
divided, into the stomach; chymification is the
conversion of it into chyme; chylification is the
conversion of the chyme into chyle; absorption is
the assumption of the chyle by the lacteals and
the transmission of it into the blood, and fecation
is the separation and discharge of the refuse
matter. Each part of this extended apparatus is
modified in structure so as specially to fit it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the performance of the office which is appropriated
to it.</p>

<p><a id="para_564"></a>564. The mouth is not merely the opening
between the two lips, but consists of an oval chamber,
bounded above by the upper jaw and the
palate; below by the tongue and the lower jaw;
laterally by the cheeks; behind by the soft palate;
and before by the lips.</p>

<p><a id="para_565"></a>565. The upper and lower jaw, the palate
bones, and the teeth, constitute the hard or the
bony parts of the mouth. The soft parts consist
of the lips, the cheeks, the soft palate, the tongue,
and the mucous membrane which lines the whole.</p>

<p><a id="para_566"></a>566. The lips and cheeks are composed principally
of muscles, covered on the outside by the
skin, and lined on the inside by the mucous membrane
of the mouth. In the interspaces between
the muscles is disposed a quantity of fat, which
gives form to the face, facilitates the movements
of the muscles, and protects the glands, blood-vessels,
and nerves, with which all these organs
are most abundantly supplied.</p>

<p><a id="para_567"></a>567. The roof of the mouth, called the palate,
consists partly of bony and partly of membranous
substance. The bony part of the palate forms an
arch in the upper jaw, the position of which in the
erect posture is horizontal: the membranous part
of the palate consists of the mucous membrane of
the mouth, which affords a covering to the bony
part of the palate.</p>

<p><a id="para_568"></a>568. From the posterior part of the bony arch
of the palate is suspended, transversely, a moveable
partition, called the soft palate (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII.</span> 1 and 2),
which is composed of muscular fibres enclosed in
the mucous membranes of the mouth. No less
than ten distinct muscles enter into the composition
of the soft palate. These muscles are disposed
in such a manner that they render the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
organ capable of descending and of applying itself
against the tongue (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII.</span> 6), so as completely
to close the passage between the mouth and the
pharynx (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLII">CLII</a>. </span> 5, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a>. </span> 1), and of ascending
and carrying itself obliquely backwards towards
the posterior wall of the pharynx, so as
completely to close the passage between the
pharynx and the nose (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a>.</span> 2, 1); hence
this moveable partition performs the office of a
double valve, closing the passage from the mouth
to the pharynx, and from the pharynx to the nose.</p>

<p><a id="para_569"></a>569. From the centre of the soft palate hangs
pendulous the conical-shaped body called the
uvula (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII.</span> 4), which consists of a small
muscle enveloped in the mucous membrane of the
mouth. The uvula assists in completing the valve
formed by the soft palate (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a>.</span> 2, 3); it is
also an important organ in the modulation of the
voice. When destroyed by disease, both the deglutition
of the food and the sound of the voice
become imperfect.</p>

<p><a id="para_570"></a>570. The lateral edges of the soft palate separate
into two layers, which enclose between
them the bodies called the tonsils (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII.</span> 3),
two glands commonly about the size of an almond.
These organs co-operate with other glands in
secreting the fluids of the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="para_571"></a>571. The tongue (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLII">CLII</a>. </span> 6, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span> 2)
is composed of six distinct muscles enveloped in
the mucous membrane of the mouth. The fibres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of these muscles are so interwoven with each
other as to form an intricate net-work; and their
number, arrangement, and exquisite organization
render the organ capable of executing a surprising
variety of movements with the most perfect
precision, and with a velocity of which the mind
can scarcely form a conception: some of these
movements being requisite to bring the aliment
under the operation of mastication, and others to
produce articulate speech.</p>

<p><a id="para_572"></a>572. The tongue divided into base, apex, and
dorsum, is supported by a bone called the hyoid
bone (os hyoides) (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVI">CXXXVI</a>. </span> 1, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span> 6),
which, unlike any other bone of the body, is
placed at a distance from the general skeleton,
and completely imbedded in muscles. This singularly
posted and delicately constructed bone is
not only connected with the tongue, but with
many other highly important muscles, to which it
affords a support and a lever.</p>

<p><a id="para_573"></a>573. Each jaw is provided with sixteen teeth
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>.</span>), arranged with perfect uniformity,
eight on each side of each jaw (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>.</span>); those
of the one side exactly corresponding with those
of the other (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>.</span>). The teeth, from the differences
they present in their size, form, mode of
connection with the jaw, and use, are divided into
four classes, namely, on each side of each jaw,
two incisors (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span> 1, 2); one
cuspid (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span> 3); two bicuspid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
(figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span> 4, 5); and three molars
(figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span> 6, 7, 8).</p>

of the Teeth.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_574"></a>574. The incisor, or cutting teeth, are situated
in the front of the jaw; that directly in the centre
is called the central; and the next to it the lateral
incisor (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>.</span>). Their office, as their name
imports, is to cut the food, which they do, on the
principle of shears or scissors.</p>

<p><a id="para_575"></a>575. Standing next to the lateral incisor is the
cuspid, canine, or eye-tooth (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>. </span>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>. </span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span>). It is the longest of all the teeth. Its
office is to tear such parts of the food as are too
hard to be readily divided by the incisors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p><a id="para_576"></a>576. Next the cuspid are the bicuspid, two on
each side (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLV">CLV</a>.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span>), so named from their
being provided with two distinct prominences or
points. Their office is to tear tough substances
preparatory to their trituration by the next set.</p>

are adapted to the concavities of those of the lower

</blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_578"></a>578. From the incisor to the molar teeth there
is a regular gradation in size, form, and use, the
cuspid holding a middle place between the incisor
and the bicuspid, and the bicuspid being in
every respect intermediate between the cuspid and
the molar. Thus the incisor are adapted only for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
cutting, the cuspid for tearing, the bicuspid partly
for tearing and partly for grinding, and the molar
solely for grinding. The incisor has only a single
root, which is nearly round, and quite simple (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>. </span> 1, 2); the cuspid has only a single root, but
this is flattened and partially grooved (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>.</span>
3); even the bicuspid has only a single root, but
this is commonly divided at its extremity, and is
always so much grooved as to have the appearance
of two fangs partially united, the body having
two points instead of one, thus approaching it to
the form of the molar (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>.</span> 4, 5); and
these last have always two, sometimes three, occasionally
four roots, and their body is greatly increased
in size, and has a complete grinding surface
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVII">CLVII</a>.</span> 6, 7, 8).</p>

<p><a id="para_579"></a>579. In some animals whose food and habits
require the utmost extension of the office of a particular
class of teeth, a corresponding development
of that class takes place. Thus in the carnivora,
as is strikingly seen in the tiger and the polar
bear, the cuspid or canine teeth are prodigiously
elongated and strengthened, in order to enable
them to seize their food, and to tear it in pieces.
On the other hand, in the rodentia, or gnawing
animals, as in the beaver, the incisors are exceedingly
elongated; while in the graminivora, and
especially in the ruminantia, the molar teeth are
by far the most developed. In each case the
other kinds of teeth are of little comparative im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>portance;
sometimes they are even altogether
wanting. Thus the shark has only one kind of
tooth, the incisor; but of these there are several
rows, and all of them the creature has the power
of erecting at will.</p>

<p><a id="para_580"></a>580. So intimately are these organs connected
with the kind of food by which life is sustained,
and the kind of food with the general habits of
the animal, that an anatomist can tell the structure
of the digestive organs, the kind of nervous
system, the physical and even the mental endowments;
that is, the exact point in the scale of organization
to which the animal belongs, merely by
the inspection of the teeth.</p>

<p><a id="para_581"></a>581. In man, the several classes of the teeth
are so similarly developed, so perfectly equalized,
and so identically constructed, that they may be
considered as the true type from which all the
other forms are deviations.</p>

<p><a id="para_582"></a>582. For the accomplishment of their office the
teeth must be endowed with prodigious strength:
for the fulfilment of purposes immediately connected
with the apparatus of digestion, it is necessary
that they should be placed in the neighbourhood
of exceedingly soft, delicate, irritable, and
sentient organs. That they may possess the requisite
degree of strength, they are constructed
chiefly of bone, the hardest organized substance.
Bone, though not as sensible as some other parts
of the body, is nevertheless sentient. The employment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of a sensitive body in the office of
breaking down the hard substances used as food
would be to change the act of eating from a
pleasurable into a painful operation. It has been
shown (vol. i. p. 84) that provision is made for
supplying to the animal a never-failing source of
enjoyment in the annexation of pleasurable sensations
with the act of eating, and that, taking
the whole of life into account, the sum of enjoyment
secured by this provision is incalculable.
But all this enjoyment might have been lost,
might even have been changed into positive pain,
nay, must have been changed into pain, but for
adjustments numerous, minute, delicate, and, at
first view, incompatible.</p>

<p><a id="para_583"></a>583. Had a highly-organized and sensitive
body been made the instrument of cutting, tearing,
and breaking down the food, every tooth, every
time it comes in contact with the food, would produce
the exquisite pain now occasionally experienced
when a tooth is inflamed. Yet a body
wholly inorganic and therefore insensible, could
not perform the office of the instrument; first,
because a dead body cannot be placed in contact
with living parts without producing irritation, disease,
and consequently pain; and, secondly, because
such a body being incapable of any process
of nutrition, must speedily be worn away by friction,
and there could be no possibility of repairing
or of replacing it. The instrument in question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
then, must possess hardness, durability, and, to a
certain extent, insensibility; yet it must be capable
of forming an intimate union with sentient and
vital organs, must be capable of becoming a constituent
part of the living system.</p>

<p><a id="para_584"></a>584. To communicate to it the requisite degree
of hardness, the hard substance forming its
basis is rendered so much harder than common
bone that some physiologists have even doubted
whether it be bone, whether it really possess a
true organic structure. That there is no ground
for such doubt the evidence is complete. For,</p>

<p>1. The tooth, like bone in general, is composed
partly of an earthy and partly of an animal substance;
the earthy part being completely removable
by maceration in an acid, and the animal
portion by incineration, the tooth under each
process retaining exactly its original form.</p>

<p>2. The root of the tooth is covered externally
by periosteum; its internal cavity is lined
by a vascular and nervous membrane, and both
structures are intimately connected with the substance
of the tooth. If these membranes really
distribute their blood-vessels and nerves to the
substance of the tooth, which there is no reason to
doubt, the analogy is identical between the structure
of the teeth and that of bone.</p>

<p>3. Though the blood-vessels of the teeth are so
minute that they do not, under ordinary circumstances,
admit the red particles of the blood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
though no colouring matter hitherto employed in
artificial injections has been able, on account of its
grossness, to penetrate the dental vessels, yet disease
sometimes accomplishes what art is incapable of
effecting. In jaundice the bony substance of the
teeth is occasionally tinged with a bright yellow
colour; and in persons who have perished by a
violent death, in whom the circulation has been
suddenly arrested, it is of a deep red colour.
Moreover, when the dentist files a tooth, no pain
is produced until the file reaches the bony substance;
but the instant it begins to act upon this
part of the tooth, the sensation becomes sufficiently
acute.</p>

<p><a id="para_585"></a>585. These facts demonstrate that the bony
matter of the tooth, though modified to fit the instrument
for its office, is still a true and proper
organized substance.</p>

<p><a id="para_586"></a>586. Each tooth is divided into body, neck,
and root (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVIII">CLVIII</a>.</span> 1, 2, 3). The body is that
part of the tooth which is above the gum, the root
that part which is below the gum, and the neck
that part where the body and the root unite (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVIII">CLVIII</a>. </span>). The body, the essential part, is the tooth
properly so called, the part which performs the
whole work for which the instrument is constructed,
to the production and support of which
all the other parts are subservient.</p>

<p><a id="para_587"></a>587. When a vertical section is made in the
tooth, it is found to contain a cavity of considerable
size (fig. CLIX, 3), termed the dental cavity,
which, large in the body of the tooth, gradually
diminishes through the whole length of the root
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIX">CLIX</a>.</span> 3). The dental cavity is lined throughout
with a thin, delicate, and vascular membrane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
continued from that which lines the jaw. It contains
a pulpy substance. This pulp, highly vascular
and exquisitely sensible, is composed almost
entirely of blood-vessels and nerves, and is the
source whence the bony part of the tooth derives
its vitality, sensibility, and nutriment. The blood-vessels
and nerves that compose the pulp enter
the dental cavity through a minute hole at the
extremity of the root (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIX">CLIX</a>. 4</span>). The membrane
which lines the dental cavity is likewise
continued over the external surface of the root, so
as to afford it a complete envelope.</p>

<p><a id="para_588"></a>588. Provision having been thus made for the
organization of the tooth, for the support of its
vitality, and for its connexion with the living
system, over all that portion of it which is above
the gum, and which constitutes the essential part
of the instrument, there is poured a dense, hard,
inorganic, insensible, all but indestructible substance,
termed enamel (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIX">CLIX</a>.</span> 2); a substance
inorganic, composed of earthy salts, principally
phosphate of lime with a slight trace of animal
matter: a substance of exceeding density, of a
milky-white colour, semi-transparent, and consisting
of minute fibrous crystals. The manner in
which this inorganic matter is arranged about the
body of the tooth is worthy of notice. The crystals
are disposed in radii springing from the centre of the
tooth (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLX">CLX</a>.</span> 3); so that the extremities of the
crystals form the external surface of the tooth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
while the internal extremities are in contact with
the bony substance (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLX">CLX</a>.</span> 3). By this arrangement
a two-fold advantage is obtained; the enamel
is less apt to be worn down by friction, and is less
liable to accidental fracture.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_589"></a>589. In this manner an instrument is constructed
possessing the requisite hardness, durability,
and insensibility; yet organized, alive, as
truly an integrant portion of the living system as
the eye or the heart.</p>

<p><a id="para_590"></a>590. No less care is indicated in fixing than
in constructing the instrument. It is held in its
situation not by one expedient, but by many.</p>

<p>1. All along the margin of both jaws is placed
a bony arch, pierced with holes, which constitute
the sockets, called alveoli, for the teeth (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXI">CLXI</a>. </span>). Each socket or alveolus is distinct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
there being one alveolus for each tooth (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXI">CLXI</a>. </span>). The adaptation of the root to the
alveolus is so exact, and the adhesion so close,
that each root is fixed in its alveolus just as a nail
is fixed when driven into a board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CLXI"></a>Fig. CLXI.</div>
<img src="images/i_189.jpg"  alt="" />
<blockquote>
<p><small>Upper jaw, showing the alveoli.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p>2. The roots of the tooth, when there are more
than one, deviate from a straight line (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLVI">CLVI</a>.</span>
6, 7, 8); and this deviation from parallelism, on
an obvious mechanical principle, adds to the firmness
of the connexion.</p>

<p>3. Adherent by one edge to the bony arch of
the jaw, and by the other to the neck of the tooth,
is a peculiar substance, dense, firm, membranous,
called the gum, less hard than cartilage, but much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
harder than skin, or common membrane; abounding
with blood-vessels, yet but little sensible; constructed
for the express purpose of assisting to fix
the teeth in their situation.</p>

<p>4. The dense and firm membrane covering the
bony arch of the jaw is continued into each
alveolus which it lines; from the bottom of the
alveolus this membrane is reflected over the root
of the tooth, which it completely invests as far as
the neck, where it terminates, and where the
enamel begins: this membrane, like a tense and
strong band, powerfully assists in fixing the
tooth.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, the vessels and nerves which enter
at the extremity of the root, like so many strings,
assist in tying it down; hence, when in the progress
of age, all the other fastenings are removed,
these strings hold the teeth so firmly to the bottom
of the socket, that their removal always requires
considerable force.</p>

<p><a id="para_591"></a>591. But a dense substance like enamel, acting
with force against so hard a substance as bone,
would produce a jar which, propagated along the
bones of the face and skull to the brain, would
severely injure that tender organ, and effectually
interfere with the comfort of eating.</p>

<p><a id="para_592"></a>592. This evil is guarded against,</p>

<p>1. By the structure of the alveoli (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXII">CLXII</a></span>.),
which are composed not of dense and compact, but
of loose and spongy bone (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXII">CLXII</a></span>.). This can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>cellated
arrangement of the osseous fibres is admirably
adapted for absorbing vibrations and preventing
their propagation (90).</p>

<p>2. By the membrane which lines the socket.</p>

<p>3. By the membrane which covers the root of
the tooth; and,</p>

<p>4. By the gum.</p>

<p>These membranous substances, even more than
the cancellated structure of the alveoli, absorb
vibrations and counteract the communication of a
shock to the bones of the face and head when the
teeth act forcibly on hard materials; so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and such nice adjustments go to secure enjoyment,
nay to prevent exquisite pain, in the simple operation
of bringing the teeth into contact in the act
of eating.</p>

</p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_593"></a>593. The teeth in mastication are passive
instruments put in motion by the jaws. The
upper jaw is fixed, the lower only is movable.
The lower jaw is capable of four different motions;
depression, elevation, a motion forwards and backwards,
and partial rotation. These simple motions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
are capable, by combination, of producing various
compound motions. Numerous muscles, some of
them endowed with prodigious power, are so disposed
and combined as to be able, at the command
of volition, to produce any of these motions that
may be required, simple or compound.</p>

to pull it obliquely towards the opposite side. When both
muscles act together, they bring the lower jaw forwards,
so as to make the fore-teeth project beyond those of the
upper jaw.</small></p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_594"></a>594. By the combination, succession, alternation,
and repetition of these motions, the lower
is made to produce upon the upper jaw all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
variety of pressure necessary for the mastication of
the food. In this process the muscles of the
tongue perform scarcely a less important part than
the muscles of the lower jaw. Some of its muscular
fibres shorten the tongue, some give it
breadth, others render it concave, and others
convex: so ample is the provision for moving this
organ to different parts of the mouth and fauces,
whether to bruise the softer parts of the aliment
against the palate, to mix it with the saliva, or to
place it under the pressure of the teeth.</p>

<p><a id="para_595"></a>595. By the combined action of the muscles
of the lower jaw and tongue, and that of the teeth,
the food is bruised, cut, torn, and divided into
minute fragments. This operation is of so much
importance that the whole process of digestion is
imperfect without it. It is proved by direct experiment
that the stomach acts upon the aliment
with a facility in some degree proportionate to the
perfection with which it is masticated. If an
animal swallow morsels of food of different bulks,
and the stomach be examined after a given time,
digestion is found to be the most advanced in the
smallest pieces, which are often completely softened,
while the larger are scarcely acted upon
at all.</p>

<p><a id="para_596"></a>596. At the same time that, by the operation
of mastication, the aliment undergoes mechanical
division, it imbibes a quantity of fluid derived from
various sources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>1. From the membrane which lines the internal
surface of the mouth, and which affords a covering
to all the parts contained in it.</p>

<p>2. From numerous minute glands placed in
clusters about the cheeks, gums, lips, palate, and
tongue. Each of these glands is furnished with
its own little duct, which, piercing the mucous
membrane, opens into the cavity of the mouth.
From these glands is derived the fluid with which
the interior of the mouth is lubricated. It consists
of a glutinous, adhesive, transparent fluid, of a
light grey tint, salt taste, and slightly alkaline
nature, termed mucus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CLXV"></a>Fig. CLXV.—<i>View of the Parotid Gland with the Muscles

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>


<p>3. From six large glands placed symmetrically,
three on each side, termed the salivary glands,
namely, the parotid (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXV">CLXV</a>.</span> 1), situated before
the ear; the submaxillary (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>.</span> 4), situated
beneath the lower jaw; and the sublingual (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span> 5), situated immediately under the tongue.
Each of these glands is provided with a duct
(figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXV">CLXV</a>. </span> 2, and cliii. 4, 5), by which it pours
the fluid it elaborates, called saliva, into the
mouth.</p>

<p><a id="para_597"></a>597. The other fluids of the mouth are always
mixed with the saliva, and are all commonly included
under that name. The secretion of these
fluids is unceasing, and they pass into the stomach
by successive acts of deglutition at nearly regular
intervals; so that the stomach, after it has been
some time without food, contains a considerable
quantity of these fluids. But they are chiefly
needed during the operation of mastication, and
two provisions are made for securing their flow in
the greatest abundance at that time.</p>

<p><a id="para_598"></a>598. First, the situation of the glands is such
that they are all exposed to the action of the
muscles of mastication (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXIII">CLXIII</a>. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXIV">CLXIV</a>. </span>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
by which action the glands are excited, a large
quantity of blood is determined to them, and the
quantity of fluid they secrete is proportionate to
the quantity of blood they receive. Secondly, the
glands are placed under the influence of the mind,
so that the very thought, and still more the taste,
of grateful food, acting upon them as an additional
stimulus, causes an additional secretion.
The quantity of fluid formed from these different
sources, and mixed with the food during the mastication
of an ordinary meal, is estimated at half
a pint. It must commonly be more than this,
because, in a case described by Dr. Gairdner, of
Edinburgh, in which the esophagus had been cut
through, it was observed that from six to eight
ounces of saliva were discharged during a meal,
which consisted merely of broth injected through
the divided esophagus into the stomach.</p>

<p><a id="para_599"></a>599. Saliva is a frothy, watery fluid, in its
healthy state nearly insipid, and of a slightly
alkaline nature. It is composed of water, a peculiar
animal substance called salivary matter,
mucus, osmazome, a little albumen, and several
salts. It produces important changes on the food.
By the water, and the salts contained in it, it
softens and dissolves the food; and thus, while it
renders it easier to be swallowed, it prepares it for
the subsequent changes it is to undergo. To this
latter object, the assimilation of the food, it seems
to communicate the first tendency by the azotized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
substances, the salivary, and the albuminous
matter which it adds to it. From this, the commencement
of the assimilative process to its completion,
animalized substances are successively
added to the food which have the property of converting
the food more and more into the nature of
animal substance.</p>

<p><a id="para_600"></a>600. Comminuted by the teeth, and softened
by the saliva, the food is reduced to a pulp. In
this pulp there is a complete admixture of all the
alimentary substances with the assimilative matter
secreted from the blood, into the nature of which
it is to be ultimately changed. The mass is at
the same time brought to the temperature of the
blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_601"></a>601. As long as the operations of mastication
and insalivation go on, the mouth forms a closed
cavity from which the food cannot escape; for the
lips enclose it before, the cheeks at the sides, the
tongue below, and the soft palate behind, the inferior
edge of which being applied in close and firm
contact with the base of the tongue, prevents
all communication between the mouth and the
pharynx.</p>

<p><a id="para_602"></a>602. When, by mastication, the food is sufficiently
divided, and by insalivation softened and
animalized to fit it for the future changes it is to
undergo, it is collected by the tongue, and carried
by that organ to the back part of the mouth. The
soft palate (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII</span>. 1), obedient to the stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
of the duly prepared food, rises the instant it is
touched by it, and affords it a free passage to the
pharynx (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a>. </span>. 10, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a>. </span>. 10).</p>

<p><a id="para_603"></a>603. The pharynx (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a></span>. 10), a muscular
bag, immediately continuous with the mouth
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a></span>. 1), is a vestibule into which open
several highly important organs. Before is the
entrance to the windpipe, termed the glottis (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 9), leading directly to the larynx (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 8);
at the sides are the mouths of two ducts, termed
the Eustachian tubes, which lead to the internal
part of the organ of hearing; above are two entrances
to the nose (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 1); and below is the
passage to the stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a></span>. 12).</p>

<p><a id="para_604"></a>604. Were the food to enter the Eustachian
tubes or the nose, it would occasion great inconvenience;
were it to enter the glottis, it would
cause death. It is prevented from entering the
Eustachian tubes and the nose by the soft palate
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CLII</span>. 1 and 2), which by the very act of
rising to afford an opening from the mouth to the
pharynx, is carried over the other apertures so as
completely to close them. By the varied direction
of the muscular fibres which enter into the composition
of this organ, it is enabled to execute the
different and even opposite motions required in
the performance of its important office.</p>

<p><a id="para_605"></a>605. The food is prevented from entering the
glottis partly by a cartilaginous valve (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 7),
termed the epiglottis, placed immediately above
the glottis, and attached to the root of the tongue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 6). In delivering the food to the
pharynx the tongue passes backwards (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 6).
In passing backwards it pushes in the same direction
the epiglottis which is attached to it, and so
necessarily carries it over the glottis, completely
closing the aperture (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIV">CLIV</a></span>. 9). At the same
time the opening is still more securely closed by
the glottis itself, in consequence of the powerful
and simultaneous contraction of the muscles that
act upon it in the production of the voice. It is
proved, by direct experiment, that the spontaneous
closure of the glottis is a more powerful agent in
excluding the food from the larynx even than the
depression of the epiglottis; but both organs
concur in producing the same result; and a
double security is provided against an event which
would be fatal.</p>

<p><a id="para_606"></a>606. It is deeply interesting to observe the
part performed in these operations by sensation
and volition, and the boundary at which their influence
terminates and consciousness itself is lost.
Mastication, a voluntary operation, carried on by
voluntary muscles, at the command of the will, is
attended with consciousness, always in the state of
health of a pleasurable nature. To communicate
this consciousness, the tongue, the palate, the lips,
the cheeks, the soft palate, and even the pharynx,
are supplied with a prodigious number of sentient
nerves. The tongue especially, one of the most
active agents in the operation, is supplied with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
less than six nerves derived from three different
sources. These nerves, spread out upon this
organ, give to its upper surface a complete covering,
and some of them terminate in sentient extremities
visible to the naked eye. These sentient
extremities, with which every point of the upper
surface, but more especially the apex, is studded,
constitute the bodies termed papillæ, the immediate
and special seat of the sense of taste. This sense
is also diffused, though in a less exquisite degree,
over the whole internal surface of the mouth.
Close to the sense of taste is placed the seat of the
kindred sense of smell. The business of both
these senses is with the qualities of the food.
Mastication at once brings out the qualities of the
food and puts the food in contact with the organs
that are to take cognizance of it. Mastication, a
rough operation, capable of being accomplished
only by powerful instruments which act with force,
is carried on in the very same spot with sensation,
an exquisitely delicate operation, having its seat
in soft and tender structures, with which the appropriate
objects are brought into contact only with
the gentlest impulse. The agents of the coarse
and the delicate, the forcible and the gentle
operations are in close contact, yet they work
together not only without obstruction, but with the
most perfect subserviency and co-operation.</p>

<p><a id="para_607"></a>607. The movements of mastication are produced,
and, until they have accomplished the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
objects of the operation, are repeated by successive
acts of volition. To induce these acts, grateful
sensations are excited by the contact of the food
with the sentient nerves so liberally distributed
over almost the whole of the apparatus. To the
provision thus made for the production of pleasurable
sensation, is superadded the necessity of
direct and constant attention to the pleasure included
in the gratification of the taste. It is justly
observed by Dr. A. Combe, that without some
degree of attention to the process of eating, and
some distinct perception of its gratefulness, the
food cannot be duly digested. When the mind is
so absorbed as to be wholly unconscious of it, or
even indifferent to it, the food is swallowed without
mastication; then it lies in the stomach for hours
together without being acted upon by the gastric
juice, and if this be done often, the stomach
becomes so much disordered as to lose its power of
digestion, and death is the inevitable result: so
that not only is pleasurable sensation annexed to
the reception of food, but the direct and continuous
consciousness of that pleasurable sensation
during the act of eating is made one of the
conditions of the due performance of the digestive
function.</p>

<p><a id="para_608"></a>608. With the operation of mastication and
one part of the process of deglutition, immediately
to be noticed, the agency of volition and sensation
cease. Beyond this the function of digestion is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
wholly an organic process. In addition to the
reasons assigned (vol. i. p. 55) why all the organic
processes are placed alike beyond the cognizance
of sense and the control of the will, there is this
special reason why, in the function of digestion,
they cease at the exact boundary assigned them.</p>

<p><a id="para_609"></a>609. Every time the act of deglutition is performed
the openings to the windpipe and to the
nose are closed, so that during this operation all
access of air to the lungs is stopped, consequently
it is necessary that the passage of the food through
the pharynx should be rapid. Mastication, a
voluntary process, may be performed slowly or
rapidly, perfectly or imperfectly, without serious
mischief; but life depends on the passage of the
food through the pharynx with extreme rapidity
and with the nicest precision. It is therefore
taken out of the province of volition and entrusted
to organs which belong to the organic life, organs
which carry on their operations with the steadiness,
constancy, and exactness of bodies whose
motions are determined by a physical law.</p>

<p><a id="para_610"></a>610. No sooner does the duly-prepared food
touch the soft palate than the whole apparatus of
deglutition is instantly in motion. This movable
partition suddenly rises to afford to the food a free
passage to the pharynx. The pharynx itself, at
the same instant, rises to receive the morsel thrust
towards it by the pressure of the tongue; and one
muscle, the stylo-pharyngeus, which concurs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
producing this movement, seems specially intended,
in addition, to expand the pharynx. Three
muscles throw their fibres around the pharynx,
termed its upper, middle, and lower constrictors,
which, the moment the morsel reaches the pharynx,
contract upon it, and embrace it firmly. At
the same instant the larynx, closing its aperture,
springs forward towards the base of the tongue,
under which it is in a manner concealed, the
additional shield of the epiglottis being simultaneously
thrown over the glottis. By this movement
of the larynx, upwards and forwards, the
course of the morsel across the dangerous passage
is shortened. All these motions take place with
such rapidity that Boerhaave said the action is
convulsive. And now the food, firmly pressed by
the pharynx, cannot return to the mouth, for the
root of the tongue is there stopping up the passage;
it cannot enter the Eustachian tubes or the
nose, for the soft palate is there closing the apertures;
it cannot enter the larynx, for a double
guard is placed upon the glottis securing its firm
closure. The food can advance in one direction
only, the direction required, that which leads to
the esophagus. Well, therefore, on the contemplation
of these complex structures and the
consent and harmony with which they act, might
Paley say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
“In no apparatus put together by art
do I know such multifarious uses so aptly contrived
as in the natural organization of the human
mouth and its appendages. In this small cavity
we have teeth of different shape; first, for cutting;
secondly, for grinding; muscles most artificially
disposed for carrying on the compound
motions of the lower jaw by which the mill is
worked; fountains of saliva springing up in different
parts of the cavity for the moistening of the
food while the mastication is going on; glands to
feed the fountains; a muscular contrivance in the
back part of the cavity for the guiding of the prepared
aliment into its passage towards the stomach,
and for carrying it along that passage. In the
mean time, and within the same cavity, is going
on other business wholly different, that of respiration
and of speech. In addition, therefore, to
all that has been mentioned, we have a passage
opened from this same cavity of the mouth into
the lungs for the admission of air, for the admission
of air exclusively of every other substance;
we have muscles, some in the larynx, and, without
number, in the tongue, for the purpose of modulating
that air in its passage, with a variety, a
compass, and a precision of which no other musical
instrument is capable; and, lastly, we have a
specific contrivance for dividing the pneumatic
part from the mechanical, and for preventing
one set of functions from interfering with the other.
The mouth, with all these intentions to serve, is a
single cavity; is one machine, with its parts
neither crowded nor confined, and each unembarrassed
by the rest.” It should be added, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
mouth is also the immediate seat of one of the
senses, and is in intimate communication with a
second sense; both these senses are always excited
while the principal business performed by
the machine is carried on, and are necessarily
excited by the very working of the machine, and
the sensations induced in the natural and sound
state of the apparatus are invariably pleasurable.</p>

<p><a id="para_611"></a>611. The food is delivered by the pharynx to
the esophagus (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLIII">CLIII</a></span>. 12), a tube composed
partly of membrane and partly of muscle. Its
muscular fibres consist of a double layer, an external
and an internal layer; the external has a
longitudinal direction; the internal describes portions
of a circle around the tube. By the contraction
of the longitudinal fibres the length, and by
the contraction of the circular fibres, the diameter
of the tube is diminished. Cellular membrane
envelops these layers of fibres externally, and
mucous membrane covers them internally. When
the tube is contracted, the mucous membrane is
disposed in folds, which disappear when it is
dilated, and these folds allow of the expansion of
the tube without injury to the delicate tissue that
lines it. The food passes slowly along the esophagus
urged towards the stomach, not by its own
gravity, but by a force exerted upon it by the
tube itself, chiefly by the contraction of its circular
fibres. Delivered at length to the stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the food is incapable of returning into the esophagus
in consequence of the oblique direction in
which the esophagus enters the stomach, the
obliquity of its entrance serving the office of a
valve.</p>

oval shape (fig <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>.), capable, in the adult,
of containing about three pints. It is placed transversely
across the upper part of the abdomen
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX</span>. 7). It occupies the whole epigastric
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CV</span>. 3), and the greater part of the left
hypochondriac regions (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CVII</span>. 3). Above, it
is in contact with the diaphragm, the arch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
which extends over it (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX</span>. 7, b); below with

larger and considerably higher than the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 7), the esophagus opens by an aperture
called the cardiac orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 2). At
the right extremity, a second aperture called the
pyloric orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 2), leads into the first
intestine.</p>

<p><a id="para_614"></a>614. Between the cardiac and the pyloric
orifices are two curvatures, one above, called the
smaller (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 6), the other below, termed
the larger curvature (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 5).</p>

<p><a id="para_615"></a>615. Like the esophagus, the stomach is composed
of two layers of muscular fibres, the external
longitudinal (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a>.</span> 9), the internal circular
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 10). By the contraction of the first
the extent of the stomach, from extremity to extremity,
is diminished, or the organ is shortened;
by the contraction of the second the extent of the
stomach, from curvature to curvature, is diminished,
or the organ is narrowed. During digestion,
by the contraction of these muscular
fibres, the capacity of the stomach is changed
alternately in both directions, whence a gentle
motion is communicated to the aliment, which is
thus brought in succession under the influence of
the agent that acts upon it.</p>

<p><a id="para_616"></a>616. A thin but strong membrane, derived
from the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the
general cavity of the abdomen, forms the external
tunic of the stomach; hence its outer covering is
called the peritoneal coat.</p>

<p><a id="para_617"></a>617. The inner or mucous coat (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 1),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
a direct continuation of the lining membrane of
the esophagus, is sometimes called also villous, on
account of the minute bodies termed villi, with
which every point of its internal surface is studded.
It is these villi which give to this surface its
pilous or velvety appearance,</p>

<p><a id="para_618"></a>618. The mucous coat is far more extensive
than the other two, in consequence of its being
plaited into a number of folds (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 1),
termed rugæ, which are so disposed as to present
the appearance of a net-work. The object of the
rugæ is to enlarge the space for the expansion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
blood-vessels and nerves, and to admit of the
occasional distension of the organ without injury
to the delicate tissues of which it is composed.</p>

<p><a id="para_619"></a>619. Immediately beneath the mucous coat are
the mucous follicles which secrete the mucous
fluid by which the inner surface of the organ is
defended. These glandular bodies are extremely
numerous, and vary considerably in diameter.
The largest are towards the great extremity, the
smaller towards the pylorus.</p>

<p><a id="para_620"></a>620. Altogether different from the mucous
secretion is another fluid, which also flows from the
mucous surface, termed the gastric or the digestive
juice, from its being the principal agent in the digestive
process. By some anatomists the gastric juice
is supposed to be secreted by minute glands placed
between the mucous and the muscular coats, provided
with ducts which pierce the mucous coat, and
which bear their fluid into the stomach precisely
as the salivary glands carry the saliva into the
mouth. It is certain that this is the case with
some animals, as in certain birds, the ostrich for
example, in which glands of considerable magnitude,
with ducts large enough to be visible, are
seen to pour the digestive fluid into the stomach.
But as no such glands have been discovered in the
human stomach, it is generally conceived that in
man the gastric juice is secreted by minute arteries
expanded upon the villi.</p>

<p><a id="para_621"></a>621. All around the pyloric orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 2)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
is placed a thick, strong, and circular muscle
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 2), termed, from its office, pylorus.
It is about four times the thickness of the muscular
coat of the stomach, and presents the appearance
of a prominent and even projecting band (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 2). From the frequent action of its
fibres, the pylorus often looks as if a piece of packthread
had been tied around it (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></span>. 3). Its
office is, by the contraction of its fibres, to guard
and close the opening from the stomach until the
aliment has been duly acted upon by the digestive
fluid.</p>

<p><a id="para_622"></a>622. The quantity of blood sent to the stomach
is greater than is spent upon any other organ except
the brain. The vessels of the stomach (fig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXIX">CLXIX</a></span>.) form two distinct layers, of which the
external is distributed to the peritoneal and muscular
coats, while the internal, after ramifying on
the fine cellular tissue which unites the muscular
and mucous tunics, penetrates the mucous coat, and
is spent upon the villi, where it forms an exquisitely-delicate
net-work. There is, moreover, an
intimate vascular connexion between the spleen,
pancreas and liver, and the stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVIII">CLXVIII</a></span>. 8,
9). The arteries which supply all these organs spring
from a common trunk, and there is the freest communication
between them by anastomosing branches.</p>

<p><a id="para_623"></a>623. Equally abundant is its supply of nerves,
some of which are derived from the organic or
non-sentient system, and others from the animal
or sentient system. The organic nerves are
spread out in countless numbers upon the great
trunks of the arteries, so as to give them a complete
envelope (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 3); these nerves, never
quitting the arteries, accompany them in all their
ramifications, and the fibril of the nerve is ultimately
lost upon the capillary termination of the
artery. It is by these organic nerves that the
stomach is enabled to perform its organic functions,
which, for the reason assigned (vol. i. p. 82),
is placed beyond volition, and is without consciousness.
By the nerves derived from the
sentient system which mingle with the organic
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI</span>.), the function of nutrition is brought
into relation with the percipient mind, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
made part of our sentient nature. By the commixture
of these two sets of nerves, derived from
these two portions of the nervous system, though
we have no <em>direct</em> consciousness of the digestive
process—consciousness ceasing precisely at the
point where the agency of volition stops (vol. i. p.
82, et seq.), yet pleasurable sensation results from
the due performance of the function. Hence the
feeling of buoyancy, exhilaration, and vigour, the
pleasurable consciousness to which we give the
name of health, when the action of the stomach is
sound: hence the depression, listlessness, and
debility, the painful consciousness which we call
disease, when the action of the stomach is unsound:
hence, too, the influence of the mental
state over the organic process; the rapidity and
perfection with which the stomach works when
the mind is happy—when the repast is but the
occasion and accompaniment of the feast of reason
and the flow of soul; the slowness and imperfection
with which the stomach works when the
mind is harassed with care struggling against
adverse events; or is in sorrow and without hope;
when the friend that sat by our side, and with
whom we were wont to take sweet counsel, is
gone, and therefore gone that which made it life
to live.</p>

<p><a id="para_624"></a>624. Renovation is the primary and essential
office of the stomach, and its organic nerves enable
it to supply the ever-recurring wants of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
system. Gratification of appetite is a secondary
and subordinate office of the stomach, and its
sentient nerves enable it to produce the state of
pleasurable consciousness when its organic function
is duly performed. By the double office thus
assigned it, the stomach is rendered what Mr.
Hunter named it, the centre of sympathies.</p>

<p><a id="para_625"></a>625. From the whole length of the great arch
of the stomach, and partly also from the commencement
of the duodenum (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>.), the
peritoneal coat of the stomach is produced, forming
a thin, delicate membranous bag, called the
omentum, or cawl (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 7). The omentum
extends from the great arch of the stomach to below
the umbilicus, and completely covers a large
portion of the anterior surface of the abdominal
viscera (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 7). Between the two fine
membranous layers of which it is composed is
contained a quantity of fat, of which substance it
serves as a reservoir, and by the transudation of
which it appears to lubricate the intestines, and
to assist in preventing their accretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_626"></a>626. The food, on reaching the stomach, does
not occupy indifferently any portion of it, but is
arranged in a peculiar manner always in one and
the same part. If the stomach be observed in a
living animal, or be inspected soon after death, it
is seen that about a third of its length towards the
pylorus is divided from the rest by the contraction
of the circular fibre called the hour-glass con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>traction
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 6). The stomach is thus divided
into a cardiac and a pyloric portion (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 6). The food, when first received by the
stomach, is always deposited in the cardiac portion,
and is there arranged in a definite manner.
The food first taken is placed outermost,
that is, nearest the surface of the stomach; the
portion next taken is placed interior to the first,
and so on in succession, until the food last taken
occupies the centre of the mass. When new food
is received before the old is completely digested,
the two kinds are kept distinct, the new being
always found in the centre of the old.</p>

<p><a id="para_627"></a>627. Soon after the food has been thus arranged,
a remarkable change takes place in the mucous
membrane of the stomach. The blood-vessels
become loaded with blood; its villi enlarge,
and its cryptæ, the minute cells between the
rugæ, overflow with fluid. This fluid is the
gastric juice, which is secreted by the arterial
capillaries now turgid with blood. The abundance
of the secretion, which progressively increases
as the digestion advances, is in proportion
to the indigestibility of the food, and the quietude
of the body after the repast.</p>

<p><a id="para_628"></a>628. In the food itself no change is manifest for
some time; but at length that portion of it which
is in immediate contact with the surface of the
stomach begins to be slightly softened. This
softening slowly but progressively increases until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the texture of the food, whatever it may have
been, is gradually lost; and ultimately the most
solid portions of it are completely dissolved.</p>

<p><a id="para_629"></a>629. When a portion of food thus acted on is
examined, it presents the appearance of having
been corroded by a chemical agent. The white
of a hard-boiled egg looks exactly as if it had
been plunged in vinegar or in a solution of potass.
The softened layer, as soon as the softening is
sufficiently advanced, is, by the action of the
muscular coat of the stomach, detached, carried
towards the pylorus, and ultimately transmitted
to the duodenum; then another portion of the
harder and undigested food is brought into immediate
contact with the stomach, becomes softened
in its turn, and is in like manner detached; and
this process goes on until the whole is dissolved.</p>

<p><a id="para_630"></a>630. The solvent power exerted by the gastric
juice is most apparent when the stomach of an
animal is examined three or four hours after food
has been freely taken. At this period the portion
of the food first in contact with the stomach is
wholly dissolved and detached; the portion subsequently
brought into contact with the stomach
is in the process of solution, while the central
part remains very little changed.</p>

<p><a id="para_631"></a>631. The dissolved and detached portion of the
food, from every part of the stomach flows slowly
but steadily beyond the hour-glass contraction,
or towards the pyloric extremity (<a href="#para_626">626</a>), in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
which not a particle of recent or undissolved food
is ever allowed to remain. The fluid, which thus
accumulates in this portion of the stomach, is a
new product, in which the sensible properties of
the food, whatever may have been the variety of
substances taken at the meal, are lost. This new
product, which is termed chyme, is an homogeneous
fluid, pultaceous, greyish, insipid, of a faint sweetish
taste, and slightly acid.</p>

<p><a id="para_632"></a>632. As soon as the chyme, by its gradual accumulation
in the pyloric extremity amounts to about
two or three ounces, the following phenomena
take place.</p>

<p><a id="para_633"></a>633. First, the intestine called duodenum, the
organ immediately continuous with the stomach,
contracts. The contraction of the duodenum is
propagated to the pyloric end of the stomach. By
the contraction of this portion of the stomach, the
chyme is carried backwards from the pyloric into
the cardiac extremity, where it does not remain,
but quickly flows back again into the pyloric extremity,
which is now expanded to receive it.
Soon the pyloric extremity begins again to contract;
but now the contraction, the reverse of the
former, is in the direction of the duodenum; in
consequence of which, the chyme is propelled
towards the pylorus. The pylorus, obedient to
the demand of the chyme, relaxes, opens, and
affords to the fluid a free passage into the duodenum.
As soon as the whole of the duly prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
chyme has passed out of the stomach, the pylorus
closes, and remains closed, until two or three
ounces more are accumulated, when the same succession
of motions are renewed with the same result;
and again cease to be again renewed, as
long as the process of chymification goes on.</p>

<p><a id="para_634"></a>634. When the stomach contains a large quantity
of food, these motions are limited to the parts
of the organ nearest the pylorus; as it becomes
empty, they extend further along the stomach,
until the great extremity itself is involved in them.
These motions are always strongest towards the
end of chymification.</p>

<p><a id="para_635"></a>635. The stomach during chymification is a
closed chamber; its cardiac orifice is shut by the
valved entrance of the esophagus, and its pyloric
orifice by the contraction of the pylorus.</p>

<p><a id="para_636"></a>636. The rapidity with which the process of
chymification is carried on is different according
to the digestibility of the food, the bulk of the
morsels swallowed, the quantity received by the
stomach, the constitution of the individual, the
state of the health, and above all, the class of the
animal, for it is widely different in different classes.
In the human stomach in about five hours after
an ordinary meal the whole of the food is probably
converted into chyme.</p>

<p><a id="para_637"></a>637. The great agent in performing the process
of chymification is the gastric juice. The
evidence of this is complete; for,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>1. As soon as the food enters the stomach a
large quantity of blood is determined to the
arteries, which secrete the gastric juice (<a href="#para_627">627</a>);
and this fluid continues to be poured into the stomach
in great abundance during the whole time
the process goes on.</p>

<p>2. The solvent power of this fluid is demonstrated
by the fact that it sometimes dissolves the
stomach itself, when death takes place suddenly
during the act of digestion in a sound and vigorous
state of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>3. On introducing into the stomach alimentary
substances inclosed in metallic balls perforated
with holes, or in pieces of porous cloth, it is found,
on removing these bodies from the stomach, after a
certain time, that the alimentary substances contained
in them are as completely digested as if
they had been in actual contact with the surface
of the stomach; the metallic ball and the cloth
remaining wholly unchanged. This experiment,
which has been often performed with the same
uniform result, was the first that led to the discovery
of the true nature of the digestive process.</p>

<p>4. Though it be impossible to imitate out of the
stomach all the circumstances under which the food
is placed within it, yet, on procuring gastric juice
from the stomachs of various animals, and mixing
it with different alimentary substances, it is found
not only to dissolve them, but to convert them into
a pultaceous mass, closely resembling chyme.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Gastric juice thus procured was put into a glass
tube with boiled beef, which had been masticated;
the tube was then hermetically sealed, and exposed
near the fire to a uniform heat: by the side
of this tube was placed another, containing the
same quantity of flesh immersed in water. In
twelve hours, the flesh in the tube containing
the gastric juice began to lose its fibrous
structure; in thirty-five hours it had nearly lost
its consistence, being reduced to a soft homogeneous
pultaceous mass. It experienced no further
change during the two following days. On
the other hand, the flesh that had been immersed
in water was putrid in sixteen hours.</p>

<p><a id="para_638"></a>638. Since alimentary substances under the
action of the stomach present precisely the
appearance exhibited by bodies exposed to the
influence of chemical agents, it appears that the
gastric juice not only dissolves the food, but
dissolves it by a chemical agency. Its action
bears no proportion to the mechanical texture of
bodies, nor to any of their physical properties. It
acts upon the densest membrane, dissolves even
bone itself; and yet produces no effect on other
substances of the most tender and delicate texture.
On the skin of fruit, on the finest fibre of flax and
cotton, it is incapable of making the slightest
impression. In this selection of substances it
perfectly resembles a chemical agent acting by
chemical affinity. On certain substances its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
action is unquestionably of a chemical nature. It
occasions the coagulation of albuminous fluids; it
prevents the accession of putrefaction; it stops
the process after it has commenced. From the
whole, it follows that the food in the stomach is
converted into chyme by the agency of a fluid
secreted by the inner surface of the stomach, and
that this change is effected by a proper chemical
action.</p>

<p><a id="para_639"></a>639. It had been long ascertained that the
gastric juice contains an uncombined acid, and that
if carbonate of lime be placed in a tube and introduced
into the stomach, the carbonate is dissolved
just as if it were put into weak vinegar. Several
years ago, it was discovered by Dr. Prout that this
free acid is muriatic acid. Some time after the publication
of Dr. Prout’s experiments, Chevreul and
Leuret and Lassaigne in France obtained different
results; but Tiedemann and Gmelin, professors in
the university of Heidelberg, in an extended series
of experiments, arrived at precisely the same conclusion
as the English physiologist, and apparently
without any previous knowledge of the researches
of the latter. Tiedemann and Gmelin state, as
the result of their experiments, that the clear ropy
fluid, or the gastric juice obtained from the stomach
some time after it had been without food, is nearly
or entirely destitute of acidity; that the presence
of food, or indeed of any stimulus to the mucous
membrane, causes the gastric juice to become dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>tinctly
acid; that this acidity increases according
to the indigestibility of the food; that the quantity
of acid poured out is very copious; that it consists
partly of muriatic and partly of acetic acid; and that
both these acids are efficient agents in the process of
digestion. Dr. Prout, who had also recognised the
presence of acetic acid, is of opinion that its
formation is an accidental occurrence not necessary
to digestion nor conducive to it; but is either
derived from the aliment, or is the result of irritation
or disease. He contends that the muriatic
acid is the efficient digestive agent.</p>

<p><a id="para_640"></a>640. The still more recent experiments of Braconnot
appear to have set this matter at rest, and
to have proved, beyond all controversy, that the
stomach, when stimulated by the presence of food or
other foreign agents, possesses the power of secreting
free muriatic acid in great quantity; and that it is
by this acid that the solution of the food is effected.
It is even found that muriatic acid is capable of
digesting alimentary substances out of the body.
It had been long known, that if meat and gastric
juice be inclosed in a tube and kept at the temperature
of the human body, a product is obtained
closely resembling chyme (637.4). M. Blondelot,
a physician at Nancy, has recently shown
that the same result may be obtained by the
digestion of the muscular fibre, in dilute muriatic
acid. In both cases the muscular fibre retains its
form and its original fibrous texture; but on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
slightest motion it divides into an insoluble mass,
perfectly homogeneous and similar to the chyme
of the stomach;<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> a very close approximation to
the actual digestive process, more especially when
it is considered that it is not possible to imitate
out of the stomach several circumstances materially
influencing chemical action under which the
food is placed within the stomach.</p>

<p><a id="para_641"></a>641. Muriatic acid, the chemical agent by
which the stomach dissolves the food, is probably
obtained from the muriate of soda (common salt)
contained in the blood. The soda, the basis of the
salt, would appear to be retained in the blood, to
preserve the alkaline condition essential to the
maintenance of the sound constitution of the blood,
while the muriatic acid, disengaged from the soda
in the process of secretion, is poured into the
stomach to act upon the food.</p>

<p><a id="para_642"></a>642. A remarkable confirmation of the correctness
of the general conclusions to which observation
and experiment had thus enabled physiologists to
arrive, is afforded by the case of a young soldier
in the American army, of the name of Alexis St.
Martin, who received a wound on the left side by
the accidental discharge of a musket. The charge,
which consisted of duck shot, and which was received
at the distance of one yard from the
muzzle of the gun, entered the side posteriorly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
an oblique direction, forward and inward; blew
off the integument and muscles to the size of a
man’s hand; fractured and carried away the
anterior half of the sixth rib; fractured the fifth
rib; lacerated the lower portion of the left lobe of
the lungs; lacerated the diaphragm, and perforated
the stomach.</p>

<p><a id="para_643"></a>643. Violent fever and extensive sloughing of
the parts injured ensued, and the life of the young
man was often in jeopardy, but he ultimately
recovered. At the distance of about a year from
the date of the accident, the injured parts had all
become sound, with the exception of the perforation
into the stomach, which never closed, but
left an aperture permanently open, two inches
and a half in circumference. This aperture was
situated about three inches to the left of the
cardia, near the left superior termination of the
great curvature. For some time the food could
be retained only by constantly wearing a compress
and bandage; but at length a small fold of
the mucous coat of the stomach appeared, which
increased until it completely filled the aperture
and acted as a valve, so as effectually to prevent
any efflux from within, while it admitted of being
easily pushed back by the finger from without:
when the stomach was nearly empty, it was easy
to examine its cavity to the depth of five or six
inches by artificial distension; but, when entirely
empty, the stomach was always contracted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
itself, and the valve generally forced through the
orifice, together with a portion of the mucous
membrane equal in bulk to a hen’s egg.</p>

<p><a id="para_644"></a>644. It chanced that the admirable opportunity
thus afforded of bringing the process of digestion,
as far as it is carried on in the stomach, under the
cognizance of sense, occurred to an observant
and philosophical mind, and it was not lost.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
The following are some of the curious and instructive
phenomena observed.</p>

<p><a id="para_645"></a>645. The inner coat of the stomach, in its
natural and healthy state, is of a light or pale pink
colour, varying in its hues according to its full, or
empty state. It is of a soft or velvet-like appearance
(<a href="#para_617">617</a>), and is constantly covered with a very
thin transparent, viscid mucus, lining the whole
interior of the organ (<a href="#para_619">619</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_646"></a>646. Immediately beneath the mucous coat
appear small spheroidal, or oval-shaped glandular
bodies, from which the mucous fluid appears to
be secreted (<a href="#para_619">619</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_647"></a>647. By applying aliment or other irritants to
the internal coat of the stomach, and observing the
effect through a magnifying glass, innumerable
minute lucid points, and very fine nervous or vascular
papillæ are seen arising from the villous
membrane, and protruding through the mucous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
coat, from which distils a pure, limpid, colourless,
slightly viscid fluid (<a href="#para_620">620</a>). This fluid, thus excited,
is invariably distinctly acid (639, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>).
The <i>mucus</i> of the stomach is less fluid, more viscid
or albuminous, semi-opaque, sometimes a little
saltish, and does not possess the slightest character
of acidity (<a href="#para_619">619</a>). On applying the tongue to the
mucous coat of the stomach in its empty, un-irritated
state, no acid taste can be perceived.
When food or other irritants have been applied
to the villous membrane and the gastric papillæ
excited, the acid taste is immediately perceptible.
The invariable effect of applying aliment to the internal,
but exposed part of the gastric membrane, is
the exudation of the solvent fluid from the papillæ.
Though the aperture of these vessels cannot be
seen even with the assistance of the best microscopes,
yet the points from which the fluid issues
are clearly indicated by the gradual appearance of
innumerable very fine lucid specks rising through
the transparent mucous coat, and seeming to
burst and discharge themselves upon the very
points of the papillæ, diffusing a limpid thin fluid
over the whole interior gastric surface.</p>

<p><a id="para_648"></a>648. The fluid so discharged is absorbed by the
aliment in contact; or collects in small drops, and
trickles down the sides of the stomach to the more
depending parts, and there mingles with the food,
or whatever else may be contained in the gastric
cavity. This fluid, the efficient cause of diges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>tion,
the true gastric juice is secreted only when
it is needed; it is not accumulated in the intervals
of digestion, to be ready for the next meal; it
is seldom if ever discharged from its proper secreting
vessels, except when excited by the natural
stimulus of aliment, the mechanical irritation of
tubes, or other excitants. When aliment is received,
the juice is given out in exact proportion
to its requirements for solution, except when more
food has been taken than is necessary for the
wants of the system.</p>

<p><a id="para_649"></a>649. On collecting this fluid, which it was
easy to obtain, it was found to be transparent, inodorous,
saltish, and acidulous to the taste; it
consisted of water, containing free muriatic and
acetic acids, phosphates and muriates, with bases
of potass, soda, magnesia, and lime, together with
an animal matter soluble in cold, but insoluble in
hot water.</p>

<p><a id="para_650"></a>650. When a portion of liquid aliment, as a
few spoonsful of soup, were introduced into the
stomach at the external orifice, the rugæ (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a> </span>. 1) immediately closed gently upon it;
gradually diffused it through the gastric cavity, and
prevented the entrance of a second quantity till this
diffusion was effected; then relaxation again took
place, and admitted of a further supply. When
solid food was introduced in the same manner,
either in large pieces or finely divided, the same
gentle contraction and grasping motions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
excited, and continued from fifty to eighty seconds,
so as to prevent more from being introduced,
without considerable force till the contraction was
at an end.</p>

<p><a id="para_651"></a>651. When the position of the body was such
that the cardiac portion of the stomach was brought
into view, and a morsel of food was swallowed in
the natural mode, a similar contraction of the
stomach, and closing of its fibres upon the bolus
was invariably observed to take place; and till
this was over, a second morsel could not be
received without a considerable effort. Hence,
in addition to the other purposes accomplished
by mastication, insalivation, and deglutition,
it is probable that these operations answer the
further use of duly regulating the time for the admission
of successive portions of the food into the
stomach.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><a id="para_652"></a>652. On watching the phenomena that take
place on the contact of a portion of food with the
stomach, the circumstances described (<a href="#para_627">627</a>) are
seen; the change in the mucous coat from a pale
pink to a deep red colour, in consequence of the
enlargement of the blood-vessels and their admission
of a greatly increased number of red particles;
the undulating motion of the stomach, in conse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>quence
of the contraction of its muscular fibres,
excited by the stimulus of food; the distillation
of the gastric juice from the enlarged and excited
papillæ; the continuous flow of this fluid until the
complete solution of the food, when food is present;
and, on the contrary, the cessation of this
discharge in a short time when it is produced by a
mechanical irritant, as the bulb of a thermometer,
although at first the gastric juice distil from the
papillæ, from the contact of such an irritant, just
as when excited by the contact of food.</p>

<p><a id="para_653"></a>653. On collecting the gastric juice and placing
it in contact with an alimentary substance out of
the stomach, its solution takes place more slowly,
but not less completely, than when retained in the
stomach. An ounce of this fluid was placed in a vial
with a piece of boiled, recently salted beef, weighing
three drachms; the vial was then tightly corked,
and immersed in water, raised to the temperature
of 100°, previously ascertained to be the ordinary
heat of the stomach. In forty minutes the process
of solution had commenced on the surface of the
beef. In fifty minutes the texture of the beef
began to loosen and separate. In sixty minutes
an opaque and cloudy fluid was formed. In one
hour and a half the muscular fibres hung loose
and unconnected, and floated about in shreds in
the more fluid matter. In three hours the muscular
fibres had diminished about one half. In
five hours only a few remained undissolved. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
seven hours the muscular texture was no longer
apparent; and in nine hours the solution was
completed.</p>

<p><a id="para_654"></a>654. At the commencement of this experiment
a piece of the same beef of equal weight and size
was suspended within the stomach by means of
a string. On examining this portion of beef at
the end of half an hour, it was found to present
precisely the same appearance as the piece in the
vial; but on the removal of the string at the end
of an hour and a half the beef had been completely
dissolved, and had disappeared, making a
difference of result in point of time of nearly seven
hours. In both, the solution began on the surface,
and agitation accelerated its progress by removing
the external coating of chyme as fast as it was
formed.</p>

<p><a id="para_655"></a>655. An ordinary dinner having been taken,
consisting of boiled salted beef, bread, potatoes,
and turnips, with a gill of pure water for drink, a
portion of the contents of the stomach was drawn off
into an open mouthed vial, twenty minutes after
the meal. The vial was placed in a water-bath,
maintained steadily at a temperature of 100°. It
was continued in this temperature for five hours.
At the end of that time the whole contents of the
vial were dissolved. On comparing the solution
with an equal quantity of chyme taken from the
stomach, little difference could be distinguished
between the two fluids, excepting that it was manifest
that the digestive process had proceeded some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>what
more rapidly in, than out of the stomach.
The food, in this experiment, after having remained
in contact with the stomach for the space of
twenty minutes, had imbibed a sufficient quantity
of gastric juice to complete its solution.</p>

<p><a id="para_656"></a>656. Fifteen minutes after half a pint of milk had
been introduced into the stomach, it presented the
appearance of a fine loosely-coagulated substance
mixed with a semi-transparent whey-coloured fluid.
A drachm of warm gastric juice poured into two
drachms of milk at a temperature of 100°, produced
a precisely similar appearance in twenty
minutes. In another experiment, when four
ounces of bread were given with a pint of milk,
the milk was coagulated and the bread reduced to
a soft pulp in thirty minutes, and the whole was
completely digested in two hours.</p>

<p><a id="para_657"></a>657. When the albumen or white of two eggs
was swallowed on an empty stomach, small white
flakes began to be seen in about ten or fifteen
minutes, and the mixture soon assumed an opaque
whitish appearance. In an hour and a half the
whole had disappeared. Two drachms of albumen
mixed with two of gastric juice out of the stomach
underwent precisely the same changes, but in a
somewhat longer time.</p>

<p><a id="para_658"></a>658. Dr. Beaumont’s observations are adverse
to the opinion, founded on numerous experiments,
that the food is arranged in the stomach in a definite
manner, and that a distinct line of separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
exists between old and new food (<a href="#para_626">626</a>). In
the human stomach, according to the subject of
these experiments, the ordinary course and direction
of the food are first from right to left along
the small arch, and thence through the large curvature
from left to right. The bolus as it enters the
cardia turns to the left, passes the aperture, descends
into the splenic extremity, and follows the
great curvature towards the pyloric end. It
then returns in the course of the smaller curvature,
makes its appearance again at the aperture,
in its descent into the great curvature, to perform
similar revolutions. These revolutions are completed
in from one to three minutes. They are
probably induced in a great measure by the circular
or transverse muscles of the stomach
(<a href="#para_615">615</a>), as is indicated by the spiral motion of the
stem of the thermometer, both in descending to the
pyloric portion, and in ascending to the splenic.
These motions are slower at first than after chymification
has considerably advanced. The whole
contents of the stomach, until chymification be
nearly complete, exhibit a heterogeneous mass of
solids and fluids, hard and soft, coarse and fine,
crude and chymified; all intimately mixed, and
circulating promiscuously through the gastric
cavity like the mixed contents of a closed vessel,
gently agitated or turned in the hand.</p>

<p><a id="para_659"></a>659. In attempting to pass a long glass thermometer
through the aperture into the pyloric portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
of the stomach, during the latter stages of digestion,
a forcible contraction is perceived at the point of
the hour-glass contraction of the stomach, and the
bulb is stopped. In a short time there is a
gentle relaxation, when the bulb passes without
difficulty, and appears to be drawn quite forcibly,
for three or four inches, towards the pyloric end.
It is then released, and forced back, or suffered to
rise again, at the same time giving to the tube a
circular or rather a spiral motion, and frequently
revolving it quite over. These motions are distinctly
indicated and strongly felt in holding the end of
the tube between the thumb and finger; and it
requires a pretty forcible grasp to prevent it from
slipping from the hand, and being drawn suddenly
down to the pyloric extremity. When the tube is
left to its own direction at these periods of contraction,
it is drawn in, nearly its whole length, to
the depth of ten inches; and when drawn back
requires considerable force, and gives to the fingers
the sensation of a strong suction power, like drawing
the piston from an exhausted tube. This
ceases as soon as the relaxation occurs, and the
tube rises again, of its own accord, three or four
inches, when the bulb seems to be obstructed from
rising further; but if pulled up an inch or two
through the stricture, it moves freely in all directions
in the cardiac portions, and mostly inclines
to the splenic extremity, though not disposed to
make its exit at the aperture. These peculiar mo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>tions
and contractions continue until the stomach
is perfectly empty, and not a particle of food or
chyme remains, when all becomes quiescent again.</p>

<p><a id="para_660"></a>660. The chambers in which the remaining part
of the digestive process is carried on are much
less accessible, and no such favourable opportunity
as that enjoyed by Dr. Beaumont has occurred of
rendering their operations manifest to the eye.
Nevertheless, the researches of physiologists have
succeeded in disclosing, with almost equal exactness
and certainty, the successive changes which
the food undergoes even in these more hidden
organs, that admit of no exposure during life
without extreme danger.</p>

<p><a id="para_661"></a>661. The chyme on passing through the pylorus
is received into a chamber (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 3) which
forms the first portion of the small intestines.
The small intestines, taken together, constitute a
tube about four times the length of the body. This
tube is conical, the base of the cone being towards
the pylorus, and its apex at the valve of the
colon, where the small intestines terminate in the
large. From the pylorus to the valve of the colon
the small intestines diminish in capacity, in thickness,
in vascularity, in the size of the villi, and in
the depth and number of the valvulæ conniventes.</p>

<p><a id="para_662"></a>662. The first portion of the small intestine is
termed the duodenum (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 3). It is about
twelve inches in length, and, unlike the stomach,
which is capable of considerable motion, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
closely tied down to the back by the peritoneum,
which imperfectly covers it. The rest of the
small intestine is divided into two portions—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
upper two-fifths of which are termed jejunum,
and the three lower ilium.</p>

<p><a id="para_663"></a>663. The duodenum, the chamber which receives
the chyme from the pylorus, is a second
stomach, which carries on the process commenced
in the first. It is assisted in the performance of
its function by two organs of considerable magnitude,
the pancreas and the liver.</p>

<p><a id="para_664"></a>664. The pancreas is a conglomerate gland
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXII">CLXXII</a></span>. 5), of an elongated form, placed in
the epigastric region, lying transversely across it,
immediately behind the stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXII">CLXXII</a></span>. 1),
and resting upon the spinal column (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXII">CLXXII</a></span>.
5). Its right extremity is attached to the duodenum
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXII">CLXXII</a></span>. 9), and its left to the spleen
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXII">CLXXII</a></span>. 4). In external appearance it resembles
the salivary glands, but it is of much
larger size, and its weight, from four to six ounces,
is three times greater than that of all the salivary
glands together. It secretes a peculiar fluid
called the pancreatic juice, which is carried into
the duodenum by a tube named the pancreatic
duct (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 7), which opens into the duodenum
about four or five inches from its pyloric
end (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 2).</p>

<p><a id="para_665"></a>665. The liver, the largest and heaviest gland
in the body, weighing about four pounds, is placed
chiefly in the right hypochondriac region (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXI">CLXXI</a></span>. 3); but a portion of it extends transversely
across the epigastric, into the left hypochondriac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
region (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase">CV. </span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">CVII. </span> 3). Its upper surface
is in contact with the diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span> 6, b);
its under surface with the pyloric extremity of the
stomach (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span> 7), and its margin can be felt
under the edges of the ribs of the right side.</p>

<p><a id="para_666"></a>666. It has been stated (473, 1.) that the fluid
secreted by the liver, unlike that formed by any
other organ of the body, is elaborated from
venous blood, derived from the veins of the digestive
organs, and that these veins uniting together,
form a common trunk called the vena portæ,
which penetrates the liver and ramifies through
it in the manner of an artery. Galen long ago
compared this venous system to a tree whose roots
are dispersed in the abdomen, and its branches
spread out through the liver. Two comparatively
small arteries, called the hepatic, nourish the
liver; the ultimate divisions of these arteries likewise
terminate in the vena portæ. The ultimate
branches of the vena portæ terminate partly in a
system of veins, called the hepatic, which like
ordinary veins return the blood to the right side
of the heart; and partly in a system of tubes,
termed the biliary ducts, which contain the fluid
secreted by the capillary branches of the vena
portæ. This fluid is the bile. The biliary ducts
uniting from all parts of the liver by innumerable
branches, at length form a single trunk termed
the hepatic duct (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 9), which carries
the bile partly to the gall bladder (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 8)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
by a duct called the cystic (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 10), and
partly to the duodenum (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 3) by a duct
named the choledoch (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 6), a common
trunk formed by the union of the cystic with the
hepatic (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 10 and 9). The choledoch
duct opens into the duodenum at the same point
as the pancreatic (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a>.</span> 7), and generally
by a common orifice.</p>

<p><a id="para_667"></a>667. The duodenum, on receiving the chyme from
the stomach, transmits it slowly along its surface.
The kind of motion by which the chyme is borne
along the surface of the duodenum is perfectly
analogous to that by which it is transmitted from
the stomach to the duodenum, irregular, sometimes
in one direction, and sometimes in another,
at one time commencing in one part of the organ,
at another time in another, always slow, but ultimately
progressive.</p>

<p><a id="para_668"></a>668. As the chyme slowly advances through the
upper part of the duodenum, the biliary and the
pancreatic juices slowly distil into the lower
portion of the organ. The bile is seen to exude
from the choledoch duct, not continually, but at
intervals, a drop appearing at the orifice, and diffusing
itself over the neighbouring surface, about
twice in a minute, while the flow of the pancreatic
juice is still slower.</p>

<p><a id="para_669"></a>669. No appreciable change takes place in the
chyme until it reaches the orifice of the choledoch
duct; but as soon as it comes in contact with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
portion of the duodenum, the chyme suddenly loses
its own sensible properties, and acquires those of
the bile, especially its colour and bitterness. But
these properties are not long retained; a spontaneous
change soon takes place in the compound.
It separates into a white fluid and into a yellow pulp.
The white fluid is the nutritive part of the aliment;
the yellow pulp is the excrementitious matter.</p>

<p><a id="para_670"></a>670. This white fluid, the proper product of the
digestive process, as far as it has yet advanced, is
called chyle. If any portion of oil or fat have
been contained in the food, the chyle is of a milk-white
colour; if not, it is nearly transparent. It
is of the consistence of cream, and it bears a close
resemblance to cream in its sensible properties.
It differs from chyme in being of a whiter colour,
more pellucid, and of a thicker consistence: it
differs also in its chemical nature, for, whereas
chyme is acid, chyle is alkaline.</p>

<p><a id="para_671"></a>671. Three fluids are mixed with the chyme in
the duodenum, each of which contributes to the conversion
of the chyme into chyle. First, the secretion
of the duodenum itself, a solvent analogous
to the gastric juice. Secondly, the secretion of the
pancreas, a watery fluid holding in solution
highly important principles, namely, a large
quantity of albumen, a matter resembling casein,
osmazome, and different salts. Thirdly, the secretion
of the liver, a compound fluid, consisting of
water, mucus, and several peculiar animal matters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
namely, resin, cholesterine, picromel, cholic acid, a
colouring matter, probably salivary matter, osmazome,
casein, and many salts.</p>

<p><a id="para_672"></a>672. There cannot be a question that the secretion
of the duodenum has a solvent power over the
chyme analogous to that of the gastric juice. Some
physiologists indeed maintain that the juice poured
out from the inner surface of the duodenum is as
powerful a solvent as the gastric juice. It is
certain that substances which have escaped chymification
in the stomach undergo that process in
the duodenum, and that there is the closest analogy
between the action of the duodenum on the chyme
and that of the stomach on the crude food.</p>

<p><a id="para_673"></a>673. The pancreatic secretion adds to the
chyme richly azotized animal substances, albumen,
casein, osmazome (<a href="#para_671">671</a>), by which it is brought
nearer the chemical composition of the blood, and
prepared for its complete assimilation into it.
The first addition of such assimilative matter, it
has been shown, is communicated by the salivary
glands, but far more important additions are now
supplied from the pancreas. Hence the larger size
of the pancreas and the more copious secretion of
the pancreatic fluid, in herbivorous than in carnivorous
animals; hence the change produced in
the size of the pancreas by a long continued change
in the habits of an animal; hence the smaller size
of the pancreas in the wild cat, which lives wholly
on animal food, than in the domestic cat, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
lives partly on animal and partly on vegetable
food.</p>

<p><a id="para_674"></a>674. The bile, the most complex secretion in the
body, accomplishes manifold purposes.</p>

<p>1. Like the pancreatic secretion, it communicates
to the chyle richly azotized animal substances,
picromel, osmazome, and cholic acid (<a href="#para_671">671</a>); by
the combination of which with the chyme, it is
brought still nearer the chemical composition of
the blood. These principles are manifestly united
with the chylous portion of the chyme, since they
are not discoverable in its excrementitious matter.</p>

<p>2. Bile has the property of dissolving fat; consequently,
when oily or fatty matters are contained
in the food, it powerfully assists in converting
these substances into chyle.</p>

<p>3. The excrementitious portion of the bile is
highly stimulant. The contact of its bitter resin
with the mucous membrane of the intestines
excites the secretion of that membrane; hence the
extreme dryness of the excrementitious matter
when the choledoch duct of an animal has been
tied; and hence the same dryness of this matter in
jaundice, when the bile, instead of being conveyed
by its appropriate duct into the duodenum, is taken
up by the absorbents, poured into the blood, and
distributed over the system.</p>

<p>4. The bitter resin of the bile stimulates to contraction
the fibres of the muscular tunic of the intestines:
by the contraction of these fibres the excre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>mentitious
matter is conveyed in due time out of
the body; hence the constipated state of the
bowels invariably induced when the secretion of
the bile is deficient, or when its natural course
into the intestines is obstructed.</p>

<p>5. The excrementitious portion of the bile exerts
an antiseptic influence over the excrementitious
portion of the food during its passage through
the intestines. In animals in which the choledoch
duct has been tied, the excrementitious portion of
the food is invariably found much further advanced
in decay than in the natural state. This is also
uniformly the case in the human body in proportion
as the secretion of the bile is deficient, or its
passage to the intestine is obstructed.</p>

<p><a id="para_675"></a>675. Such appear to be the real purposes accomplished
by the bile in the process of digestion.
Several uses have been assigned to it, in promoting
this process, which it does not serve. Seeing
the instantaneous change wrought in the chyme on
its contact with the bile, it was reasonable to suppose
that the main use of the bile was to convert
chyme into chyle, a purpose apparently of sufficient
importance to account for the immense size of the
gland constructed for its elaboration. The soundness
of this conclusion appeared to be established
by direct experiment. Mr. Brodie placed a
ligature around the choledoch duct of an animal:
after the operation the animal ate as usual: on
killing the animal some time after it had taken a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
meal, and examining the body immediately after
death, it was clear that chymification had gone on in
the stomach just as when the choledoch duct was
sound, but no chyle appeared to be contained
either in the intestines or in the lacteals. In the
lacteals there was found only a transparent fluid,
which was supposed to consist of lymph and of the
watery portion of the chyme. Mr. Brodie’s experiments
seemed to be confirmed by those of Mr.
Mayo, who arrived at the conclusion, that when
the choledoch duct is tied, and the animal is examined
at various intervals after eating, no trace
whatever of chyle is discoverable in the lacteal
vessels. But these experimentalists inferred that
no chyle existed in the intestines or lacteals,
because there was present no fluid of a milk-white
colour, a colour not essential to chyle, but dependent
on the accident of oily or fatty matter
having formed a portion of the food. These
experiments have been repeated in Germany by
Tiedemann and Gmelin, and in France by Leuret
and Lassaigne, who have invariably found, after
tying the choledoch duct, nearly the same chylous
principles, with the exception of those derived
from the bile, as in animals perfectly sound; and
the English physiologists have since admitted that
their German and French colaborateurs have
arrived at conclusions more correct than their own.</p>

<p><a id="para_676"></a>676. The bile consists then of two different portions;
a highly animalized portion, which combines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
with the chyme and exalts its nature by approximating
it to the condition of the blood; and an excrementitious
portion, which, after accomplishing
certain specific uses, is carried out of the system
with the undigested matter of the food. The excrementitious
portion of the bile, namely, the resin, the
fat, the colouring principle, the mucus, the salts,
constitute by far the largest portion of it. These
constituents of the bile for the most part contain
a very large proportion of carbon and hydrogen,
and the reasons have been already fully stated
(473, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>) which favour the conclusion that the
elimination of these substances under the form of
bile is one most important mode of maintaining
the purity of the blood, and that the liver is thus a
proper respiratory organ, truly auxiliary to the
lungs. It is a beautiful arrangement, and like one
of the adjustments of nature, that the bile, the
formation of which abstracts from the blood so
large a portion of carbon and hydrogen as to maintain
the purity of the circulating mass and to
counteract its putrescent tendency, acts on the
excrementitious portion of the food, always highly
putrescent, as a direct and powerful antiseptic;
that the very matter which is eliminated on
account of the putrid taint it communicates to
the blood, on its passage out of the body, stops
the putrefaction of the substances which have
been ministering to the replenishment of the
blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_677"></a>677. The chyle, thick, glutinous, and adhesive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
attaches itself with some degree of tenacity to the
mucous surface of the duodenum. Nevertheless,
by the successive contractions of the muscular
fibres of the duodenum the fluid is slowly but
progressively propelled forwards. The separation
of the excrementitious matter becomes more complete,
and consequently the chyle more pure as it
advances, until, having traversed the course of the
duodenum, it enters the second portion of the small
intestines, the jejunum.</p>

<p><a id="para_678"></a>678. The jejunum, so called because it is commonly
found empty, and the ilium, named from
the number of its convolutions, on account of
their great length, are provided with a distinct
membrane to support them, and to retain them in
their situation, termed the mesentery.</p>

<p><a id="para_679"></a>679. The mesentery is a broad membrane composed
of two layers of peritoneum. Between these
two layers, at one extremity of the duplicature, is
placed the intestines, while the other extremity is
attached to the spinal column. The mesentery being
much shorter than the intestines, the intestines
are gathered or puckered upon the membrane, by
which beautiful mechanical contrivance they are
held in firm and close contact with each other, yet
their convolutions cannot be entangled, nor can
they be shaken from their place by the sudden
and often violent movements of the body. It
sometimes happens, in consequence of disease, that
the convolutions of the intestines are glued together
by the effusion of lymph, and then the most trifling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
causes are capable of producing the severest
symptoms of obstruction in the bowels.</p>

<p><a id="para_680"></a>680. The internal surface of the small intestines
is distinguished,</p>

<p>1. By the number of the mucous glands, which
may be seen by a magnifying glass to consist
partly of a prodigious number of the minutest
follicles, not collected in groups, but equally scattered
throughout; and partly of glands of a larger
dimension, disposed in groups at particular parts
of the canal.</p>

<p>2. By the increase in the number and size of
the villi, of which there are about four thousand
to the surface of a square inch. Like those of
the stomach, the villi of the small intestine are
composed of arteries, veins, nerves, and mucous
ducts; but to the villi of the small intestine, in
length about one-fourth of a line, there is added a
new vessel, the absorbent of the chyle, the lacteal
(figs. 175 and 176), so named from the milk-like
chylous fluid which it contains.</p>

<p>3. By the great extension of the mucous coat
obtained by the disposition of the membrane into
the folds called valvulæ conniventes (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIII">CLXXIII</a></span>.).
These folds, which rarely extend through the whole
circle of the intestine, are often joined by communicating
folds (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIII">CLXXIII</a></span>.). The folds are broadest
in the middle, and narrowest at the extremities
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIII">CLXXIII</a>.</span>). In general, they are about a line
and a half broad. One edge of the fold is loose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
but the other is fixed to the intestine (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIII">CLXXIII</a>.</span>).
The office of these folds is, first, without increasing
space, to extend surface for the distribution
of the villi; and, secondly, to retard the
flow of the chyle, by opposing to its descent valves
so constructed and disposed as, without arresting
its progress, to moderate and regulate its course,
in order that time may be allowed for its absorption.</p>

</p></blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_681"></a>681. The onward flow of the chyle through
the course of the small intestines is effected by the
action of the double layer of muscular fibres, the
circular and the longitudinal fasciculi which
compose its muscular coat (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIV">CLXXIV</a>.</span>). The
disposition of the muscular fibres of the alimentary
canal in general, and of this part of it in
particular, deserves special notice. The ordinary
arrangement and action of muscular fibres would
not have produced in this case the kind and degree
of motion required. The muscular fibres
that compose the ventricles of the heart are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
accumulated and disposed, that their contraction
originates, and communicates energetic impulse.
The muscles of the arm are so accumulated and
disposed that their contraction originates the like
energetic impulse. Muscles so accumulated in
the alimentary canal would have produced motion,
indeed, but motion not only not accomplishing the
end in view, but directly defeating it. In order
to obtain the kind and degree of motion in this
case required, the firm and thick muscle is attenuated
into minute, delicate, and thready fibres, not
concentrated in a bulky mass, so as to obtain by
their accumulation a great degree of force; but
spread out in such a manner as to form a thin and
almost transparent coat. The tender fibres composing
this delicate coat, by their contraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
produce two alternate, gentle, almost constant
motions, called the peristaltic, from its resemblance
to the motion of the earth-worm, and the
antiperistaltic. By the peristaltic action motion
is begun at once in several parts of the canal.
Whenever the chyle is applied in a certain quantity
to any part of the intestines, that part contracts,
and makes a firm point, towards which the portions
both above and below are drawn, by means of
the longitudinal fibres which shorten the canal, and
at the same time dilate the under part. By the
antiperistaltic action, which is the exact reverse
of the former, the chyle is turned over and over,
and exposed to the orifices of the lacteal vessels;
while, by the motion of the chyle forwards and
backwards, and backwards and forwards, produced
by these two actions constantly alternating with
each other, its slow, gentle, but ultimately progressive
course is secured.</p>

<p><a id="para_682"></a>682. The chyle thus gently moved along the extended
surface of the jejunum and ilium, and still
in its course acted upon in some degree by the
secretions poured out upon the mucous membrane,
successively disappears, until at the termination
of the ilium (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXI">CLXXI</a>.</span> 5) there is scarcely any
portion of it to be perceived. It is taken up by
the vessels termed lacteals.</p>

<p><a id="para_683"></a>683. The lacteal vessels (figs. 175 and 176),
take their origin on the surface of the villi, by
open mouths, too minute to be visible to the naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
eye, but distinguishable under the microscope.
These minute, pellucid tubes, wholly countless in
number, are composed of membranous coats so
thin and transparent that the milky colour of their
contents, from which they derive their name, is
visible through them, and yet they are firm and
strong. They present a jointed appearance (figs.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVI">CLXXVI</a>. </span> 4, and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>. </span> 7). Each joint denotes
the situation of the valves with which they are provided,
and which are placed at regular distances
along their entire course (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a>.</span> 1 and 2).
These valves, which are generally placed in pairs
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a>.</span> 2), consist of a delicate fold of membrane
of a semilunar form, one edge of which
is fixed to the side of the vessel, while the other
lies loose across its cavity (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a>.</span> 2). So firm
is this membrane, and so accurately does it perform
the office of a valve, that even after death it
is capable of supporting a column of mercury of
considerable weight without giving way, and of
preventing a retrograde course of the fluid. The
lacteals are nourished by blood-vessels, and animated
by nerves, and it is conceived that they
must be provided with muscular fibres, or some
analogous tissue, for they are obviously contractile,
and it is by this contractile power that their contents
are moved. The delicacy and transparency
of the vessels, however, render it impossible to distinguish
the different tissues which compose their
walls.</p>

examined some hours after a meal, the lacteals are
seen turgid with chyle, covering its entire surface
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXV">CLXXV</a>.</span> 1). These vessels, which are sometimes
of such magnitude and in such numbers as
entirely to conceal the ramifications of the blood-vessels,
unite freely with each other, and form a
net-work, from the meshes of which proceed
branches which, successively uniting, form branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
of a larger size (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXV">CLXXV</a></span>. 2). These larger
branches perforate the mucous coat and pass for
some way between the mucous and the muscular
tunics: at length they perforate both the muscular
and the peritoneal coats, when, from having been
on the inside of the intestine, they get on the outside
of it (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVI">CLXXVI</a></span>. 3, 4), and are included, like
the intestine itself, between the layers of the mesentery.
All the different sets of lacteals converging
and uniting together, form an exceedingly complicated
plexus of vessels within the fold of the
mesentery. Radiating from this plexus, the lacteals
advance forwards until they reach the glands, called,
from their being placed between the fold of the

<p><a id="para_685"></a>685. On reaching the first series of glands (fig.
clxxvii. 2), the lacteals penetrate the substance
of the gland, in the interior of which they communicate
with each other so freely, and form such innumerable
windings, that the gland seems to consist
of a congeries of convoluted lacteals. Emerging
from the first series of glands, the lacteals proceed
on their course to the second series (fig., <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>. </span> 3),
which they penetrate, and in the interior of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
they present the same convoluted appearance as
in the first set. On passing out of this second
series of glands, the lacteals unite together, and
compose successively larger and larger branches,
until at length they form two or three trunks
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 4), which terminate in the small
oval sac (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 5), termed the receptacle
of the chyle (receptaculum chyli).</p>

<p><a id="para_686"></a>686. In this oval sac or receptacle of the chyle
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 5), which rests upon the second or
the first lumbar vertebra, also terminate the trunks
of the general absorbent vessels of the system
(fig. clxxvii. 6), called from the <em>lymph</em> or the
pellucid fluid which they contain, lymphatics, as
the lacteals are named from the lactitious or milky
appearance of their contents.</p>

<p><a id="para_687"></a>687. The receptacle of the chyle produced
forms the thoracic duct (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 7), a canal
about three lines in diameter. This tube rests
upon the spinal column, ascends on the right side
of the aorta, passes through the aortic opening
in the diaphragm (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXIV">CXXXIV</a>.</span> 9, 10), and
enters into the chest. Here it forms a transparent
tube about the size of a crow-quill; it
rests upon the bodies of the dorsal vertebræ; it
continues to ascend still on the right side of the
aorta, until it reaches the sixth or fifth dorsal
vertebra, when changing its direction, it passes
obliquely over to the left side (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 7).
From this point it continues its course upwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
on the left side of the neck, as high as the sixth
cervical vertebra; when suddenly turning forwards
and a little downwards, it terminates its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
course in the angle formed by the union of the internal
jugular with the subclavian vein (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>. </span> 8, 9). At its termination in these great
venous trunks are placed two valves, which prevent

<p><a id="para_688"></a>688. This account of the course of the thoracic
duct is a description of the course of the chyle.
Performing a double, circuitous, and slow circulation
through the minute convoluted tubes of which
the double series of mesenteric glands are composed,
the chyle, in its receptaculum, is mixed
with the contents of the lymphatic vessels, lymph
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVII">CLXXVII</a>.</span> 6, 5), that is, organic matter brought
from every surface and tissue of the body. Both
fluids, chyle and lymph, mixed and mingled, flow
together into the thoracic duct, by which in the
course traced (<a href="#para_687">687</a>) they are poured into the
blood, just as the venous torrent is rushing to
the heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVIII">CLXXVIII</a>.</span> 6, 9, 11).</p>

<p><a id="para_689"></a>689. Thus, the final product of digestion, the
chyle; particles of organized matter, the lymph;
and venous blood, that is, blood which has already
circulated through the system commingled, flow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
together to the right heart, by which it is transmitted
to the lungs, where all these different fluids
are converted into one substance, arterial blood, to
be by the left heart sent out to the system for its
support.</p>

<p><a id="para_690"></a>690. While these processes are going on, another
and a very important function is performed by the
remaining portion of the alimentary canal. It is
the office of this part of the apparatus to carry out
of the body that portion of the aliment which is
incapable of being converted into chyle. The preparation
of the excrementitious part of the aliment
for its expulsion constitutes the process of fecation.
The organs in which this process is carried on, and
by which the excrementitious matter, when duly
prepared for its removal, is conveyed from the body,
are the large intestines.</p>

<p><a id="para_691"></a>691. The large intestines (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span>) consist
of the cæcum, the colon and the rectum (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>. </span>). The cæcum varies in length from two
inches to six; the colon is about five feet in
length, and the rectum is about eight inches.</p>

<p><a id="para_692"></a>692. The ilium opens into the cæcum (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>. </span> 8, 10), just as the esophagus opens into
the stomach. At this point the ilium is elongated,
forming two concentric folds which join at their
horns, and between the folds are placed a number
of muscular fibres. In this manner is constructed
a valve, which is termed the valve of the colon.
It is placed in a transverse direction across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
intestine, and its action as a valve is very complete.
It admits of the free passage of the contents
of the small intestines into the large, but it
prevents the return of any portion of the contents
of the latter into the former.</p>

<p><a id="para_693"></a>693. The colon is distinguished by its capacious
size, its great length, and its longitudinal bands,
which consist of strong muscular fasciculi (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>. </span> 11). It is divided into an ascending portion
which occupies the right iliac and hypochondriac
regions (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span> 11); the transverse portion,
called its arch, which is placed directly across the
epigastric region (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span> 12), a descending
portion which occupies the left hypochondriac
region (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span> 13), and a fourth portion,
which being curved somewhat like the italic letter
S, is called the sigmoid flexure, which occupies the
left iliac region (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span> 14). The sigmoid
flexure terminates in the last portion of the alimentary
canal, called the rectum (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXIX">CLXXIX</a>.</span> 15),
which is placed in the hollow of the sacrum, and
which follows the curvature of that bone (fig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
<span class="smcap">XLV.</span> 5). The circular fibres of the rectum are
accumulated at the termination of the bowel to
form the internal sphincter of the anus. External
to this is placed another set of fibres, which constitute
the external sphincter.</p>

<p><a id="para_694"></a>694. The mucous membrane of the large intestines
is disposed differently from that of the small intestines,
and the mucous membrane of the colon still
differently from that of the rectum. In the colon
the mucous membrane, instead of being disposed
in the form of valvulæ conniventes, is so arranged
as to divide its whole surface into minute apartments
or cells by which the descent of the fecal
matter is retarded still more than the descent of the
chyle by the valvulæ conniventes. Some particles
of chyle do, however, continue to be separated
from the fecal matter, even in the large intestines;
and in order that nothing may be lost, a few valvulæ
conniventes, with their lacteals, appear here
also, while the cells of the colon, by retarding the
descent of the fecal matter, allow time for the
more complete separation and absorption of the
chylous particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_695"></a>695. In the rectum the mucous membrane is
plaited into large transverse folds, which disappear
as the fecal matter descends into the bowel, accumulates
in it, and distends it; an arrangement
which gives to this portion of the intestine its
power of distension, so closely connected with our
convenience and comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p><a id="para_696"></a>696. As soon as that portion of the alimentary
matter which is transmitted to the large intestines
reaches the colon it ceases to be alkaline, the distinctive
character of the contents of the small
intestines, and becomes acid, just as the whole
alimentary mass is acid at the commencement of
digestion in the stomach. It acquires albumen;
its gases are no longer the same, for whereas pure
hydrogen is contained in the small intestines,
none is ever found in the large, but in the place of
it, carbureted and sulphureted hydrogen; and now
for the first time it receives its peculiar odour.
As it continues to descend, its fluid parts are progressively
absorbed, so that it becomes more and
more solid, until it reaches the rectum, when it is
almost dry. Here the accumulation of it goes on
to a considerable extent, the peristaltic action at
first excited by the distension of the rectum being,
it would appear, counteracted by the contraction
of the external sphincter of the anus. When, however,
the distension of the bowel reaches a certain
point, it produces a sensation which leads to the
desire to expel its contents. The bowel is now
thrown into action by an effort of the will, and
that action is powerfully assisted by the descent of
the diaphragm and the contraction of the abdominal
muscles, actions also induced by an effort
of the will. Thus the action of the first part of
the digestive apparatus, that which is connected
with the reception and partly with the deglutition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of the food, is attended with consciousness, and is
placed under the control of the will; the main
portion of the digestive apparatus, that in which
the essential part of the digestive process is carried
on, is without consciousness, and is placed beyond
the influence of volition; the last portion of the
digestive apparatus, that connected with the expulsion
of the non-nutrient portion of the aliment,
again acquires sensibility and consciousness, and
is placed under the control of the will. The
striking differences in the arrangement of the muscular
fibres in these different parts of the apparatus,
in accordance with the widely different function
performed by them; the powerful muscles
connected with the prehension, mastication and
deglutition of the food; the delicate and transparent
tissue of fibres forming the muscular coat of
the stomach and small intestines; the increase in
the number and strength of the fibres of the large
intestines, and the prodigious accession to them in
the rectum, are adjustments not only exquisite and
admirable in their own nature, but so indispensable
to our well-being and comfort, that were the
appropriate action of either to be suspended but
for a short period, life would be extinguished, or
if it could be protracted, it would be changed into
a state of unbearable torment.</p>

<p><a id="para_697"></a>697. From the preceding account of the structure
and action of the apparatus of digestion, on a comparison
of all the phenomena, it appears that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
successive stages of the process are marked by the
progressive approximation of the food to the
nature of the blood. The main constituents, of the
blood are albumen, fibrin, an oily principle, and red
particles. Even in the chyme there are traces of
albumen, with globules, not indeed to be compared
in number with the red particles of the blood,
smaller in size, and without colour, but still of an
analogous nature. In the chyle of the duodenum
the quantity of albumen is larger, there are traces
of fibrin, and of an oily matter, and the number of
the globules is increased. In the chyle, after its
exit from the mesenteric glands, the albumen, the
fibrin, the oil, the globules, and more especially
the two first and the last, are greatly increased.
But in the chyle when it reaches the thoracic duct,
these principles are so augmented, concentrated,
and approximated to the state in which they
exist in the blood, that the chyle is now capable
of undergoing the characteristic process of the
blood; for as the blood, when drawn from a vein,
undergoes spontaneous coagulation, so the chyle,
when drawn from the thoracic duct, separates into
three parts; a solid substance or clot, which
remains at the bottom of the vessel; a fluid
which surrounds the clot; and a thin layer of
matter, which is spread over the surface of the
fluid. The solid substance is analogous to the
fibrin, and the fluid to the serum of the blood;
while the layer of matter which is spread over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
fluid is of an oily nature: moreover, the chyle, when
in contact with the air, quickly changes to a red
colour, and abounds with minute particles of
various sizes, but the largest of which is not yet
equal to the diameter of the red particles of the
blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_698"></a>698. The changes wrought upon the food, by
which it is thus approximated to the chemical composition
of the blood, are effected, as has been
shown, partly by the gastric and intestinal juices,
and partly by matters combined with the food
highly animalized in their own nature, and endowed
with assimilative properties, as the salivary
secretion mixed with the food during mastication;
the pancreatic and biliary secretions mixed with
the food during the conversion of the chyme into
chyle; and the mesenteric secretions mixed with
the elaborated chyle of the mesenteric glands, and
lastly, organized particles which have already
formed a part of the living structures of the body
mixed with the chyle under the form of lymph in
the thoracic duct.</p>

<p><a id="para_699"></a>699. The lymph, until lately regarded as excrementitious,
is really highly animalized, partly
combined with the chyle as its last and highest
assimilative matter; whence the compound formed
by the admixture of chyle and lymph is far more
proximate to the blood than the purest and most
concentrated chyle; and partly returning with the
chyle to the lungs, to receive there a second depuration,
and thereby a higher elaboration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p><a id="para_700"></a>700. There is evidence that there is a series of
organs specially provided for the elaboration of
the lymph no less than of the chyle. There are
organs manifestly connected with the digestive
apparatus, to which physiologists have found it
extremely difficult to assign a specific office. These
organs have a structure in some essential points
alike; that structure is strikingly analogous to
the organization of glands: like glands, they
receive a prodigious quantity of arterial blood, and
are supplied with a proportionate number of
organic nerves; yet they are without an excretory
duct. The organs in question are the bodies
called the renal capsules, placed above the kidneys;
the thyroid and thymus glands situated in the neck,
and the spleen in close connexion with the stomach.</p>

<p><a id="para_701"></a>701. These organs, however analogous in structure
to glands, cannot, it has been argued, be
secreting organs, because they are destitute of an excretory
duct, do not manifestly form from the blood
any peculiar secretion, or, if they do, since there are
no means of detecting where it is conveyed, it is
impossible to understand how it is appropriated.
But if these organs collect, concentrate, and elaborate
lymph, preparatory to its admixture with the
chyle and to its being sent a second time into the
blood to undergo a second process of depuration,
they perform the function of glands; and their
want of an excretory duct, which has hitherto
rendered their office so obscure, is accounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
for; they do not need distinct tubes for the
transmission of any product of secretion; the
lymphatic vessels which proceed from them and
which convey the fluid they elaborate into the
receptacle of the chyle, are their excretory ducts.
That one of these organs, the spleen, is specially
connected with the elaboration of the lymph, is
manifest, both from its chemical nature and
from the remarkable change which takes place
in the chyle the moment the lymph from the
spleen is mixed with it. Tiedemann and Gmelin
state, as the uniform result of their observations
and experiments, that the quantity of fibrin contained
in the chyle is greatly increased, and that
it actually acquires red particles as soon as the
lymph from the spleen is mixed with it, and that
the lymph from the spleen superabounds both
with fibrin and with red particles. That the
organs just enumerated, with the spleen, perform
a similar function, is inferred from their being, like
it, of a glandular structure, and without any
excretory duct. If the spleen be really one of a
circle of organs appropriated to a function such as
is here supposed, a purpose is assigned to it adequate
to its rank in the scale of organization;
inferior to few, if its importance be estimated by
the quantity of arterial blood with which it is
supplied; yet this is the organ for which Paley
could find no better use than that of serving for
package.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p><a id="para_702"></a>702. But in whatever mode the lymph be elaborated,
it is certain that it consists of matter highly
animalized, and that its most important principles,
its albumen, its fibrin, its globules, and even its
salts, are in a chemical condition closely resembling
that in which they exist in the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_703"></a>703. It will appear hereafter that all the proximate
principles of which the body is composed are
reducible by analysis to three, namely, sugar, oil,
and albumen: of these, sugar and oil are the least,
and albumen the most highly organized. Every
alimentary substance must contain at least one
of these proximate principles, and in the various
articles which compose an ordinary meal always
two, and often all three, are afforded in abundance.
From the phenomena which have been stated, it is
clear that the digestive organs, in acting on these
principles, exert the following powers.</p>

<p>1. A solvent power. The first action of the
stomach on the alimentary substances presented
to it is to reduce them to a fluid state. No substance
is nutritious which is not a fluid, or
capable of being reduced to a fluid. The stomach
reduces alimentary substances to a fluid state by
combining them with water. Water enters into
the composition of organized bodies in two states,
as an essential and as an accidental element. A
quantity of water is contained in sugar when reduced
to its dryest state; this water cannot be
dissipated without the decomposition of the sugar;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
it is therefore an essential constituent of the compound.
Water is combined with sugar in its moist
state: of this water much may be removed without
destroying the essential properties of the sugar:
this part of the water is therefore said to be an
accidental constituent of the sugar. In most cases
organized bodies contain water in both these
forms; and though it is commonly impossible to
discriminate between the water that is essential
and that which is accidental, yet the mode of
union among the elements of bodies in these two
states of their combination with water are essentially
different. The stomach has the power of combining
water with alimentary substances in both
these forms. Thus fluid albumen, or white of egg,
presented to the stomach is immediately coagulated
or converted into a solid. Soon this solid begins
to be softened, and the softening goes on until it is
again reduced to a fluid. What was fluid albumen
in the white of egg is now fluid albumen in
chyme; but the albumen has undergone a remarkable
change. Out of the stomach the albumen of
the egg may be converted by heat into a firm solid;
but the albumen of the chyme is capable of being
converted only into a loose and tender solid. In
passing from its state in the egg to its state in the
chyme, the albumen has combined with a portion
of water which has entered as an essential ingredient
into its composition. By this combination
the compound is reduced from what may be called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
a strong to a weak state. This is the first action
exerted by the stomach on most alimentary substances.
They are changed from a concentrated to
a diluted, from a strong to a weak state: the power
by which the stomach effects this change is called
its reducing power, and the agent by which it
accomplishes it is the gastric juice; the essential
ingredient of which has been shown to be muriatic
acid, or chlorine (639, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>). The muriatic
acid obtained from the common salt of the blood
is poured in the form of gastric juice into the stomach,
dissolves the food, combines it with water,
reduces it from a concentrated solid to a dilute
fluid; and thus brings it into the condition proper
for the subsequent part of the process.</p>

<p>2. A converting power. Since whatever be
the varieties of food, the chyme invariably forms a
homogeneous fluid, the stomach must be endowed
with the power of transforming the simple alimentary
principles into one another; the saccharine
into the oily, and the oily into the albuminous.
The transformation of the saccharine into the
oleaginous principle is traceable out of the body in
the conversion of sugar into alcohol, which is
essentially an oil. That the same transformation
takes place within the body is indubitable. The
oleagenous and the albuminous principles are
already so nearly allied in nature to animal substance
that they do not need to undergo any essential
change in their composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>3. A completing power. When the alimentary
substances have been reduced and formed into
chyme, when the chyme has been converted into
chyle, and when the chyle absorbed by the lacteals
is transmitted to the mesenteric glands, it undergoes
during its passage through these organs a process
the direct reverse of that to which it is subjected in the
stomach; for whereas it is the office of the stomach
to combine the alimentary substances with water,
it is one office of the mesenteric glands to remove
the superfluous water of the chyle; to abstract
whatever particles of matter may be contained in
the compound which are not indispensable to it,
and to concentrate its essential constituents; and
consequently these organs exert on the digested
aliment a completing, in contradistinction to a
reducing power.</p>

<p>4. A vitalizing power. When sugar is converted
into oil, when oil is converted into albumen,
when albumen, by the successive processes
to which it is subjected is completed, that is,
when the alimentary substances are made to
approximate in the closest possible degree to the
nature of animal substance, they must undergo
a still further change, more wonderful than any of
the preceding, and far more inscrutible; they
must be endowed with vitality; must be changed
from dead into living matter. Living substance
only is capable of forming a constituent part of
living substance. The ultimate action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
digestive organs is the communication of life to
the food, to which last and crowning process
the reducing, converting, and completing processes
are merely subordinate and preparatory.
Of the agency by which this process is effected we
are wholly ignorant; we know that it goes on;
but the mode in which it is accomplished is veiled
in inscrutable darkness.</p>

<p><a id="para_704"></a>704. Blood is alive; blood is formed from the
food; life is communicated to the food before it is
mixed with the blood. The blood is essentially albumen,
which it contains in the form of albumen properly
so called, in that of fibrin, and in that of red
particles. In the thoracic duct the strong albumen
of the lymph is mixed with the weaker albumen of
the chyle. At the point where the thoracic duct
terminates in the venous system, lymph and chyle
are mixed with venous blood, and all commingled
are borne directly to the lungs. There the carbon
with which the venous blood is loaded is expelled
in the form of carbonic acid gas; the particles of
the lymph undergo some, as yet, unknown change,
exalting their organization; and the water hitherto
held in chemical union with the weak albumen of
the chyle, is separated and carried out of the system
together with the carbonic acid gas in the
form of aqueous vapour. By this removal of its
aqueous particles the ultimate completion is given
to the digested aliment; and the weak and delicate
albumen of the chyle is converted into the
strong and firm albumen of the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p><a id="para_705"></a>705. It has been stated (<a href="#para_539">539</a>), that though
gelatin enters abundantly into the composition of
many tissues of the body, and performs most important
uses in the economy, it is never found in
the blood; that it is formed from the albumen of
the blood by a reducing process, in consequence
of which carbon is evolved, which unites with the
free oxygen of the blood, forming carbonic acid,
thus conducing, among other purposes, to the
production of animal heat. It is equally remarkable,
that though the lymphatics or absorbents
arise in countless numbers from every tissue of
the body, and are endowed with the power of
taking up every constituent particle of every
organ, solid as well as fluid, yet gelatin is never
found in the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatics
contain only albumen in a form far more proximate
to the blood than that of the chyle; consequently,
before the gelatin of the body is taken up
by the lymphatics, it must be reconverted into
albumen; that is, the absorbed gelatin must
undergo a process analogous to that which gelatin
and other matters undergo in the stomach and
duodenum; it follows that the digestive process is
not confined to the stomach and duodenum, but
is carried on at every point of the body. Hence
there are two processes of digestion, a crude and a
refined process. The crude process is carried on in
the stomach and duodenum, in which dead animal
matter is converted into living substance, as yet,
however, possessing only the lowest kind of vitality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
The capillary arteries receiving the substance thus
prepared for them, build it up into structure perhaps
the lowest and coarsest, the least organized,
and capable of performing only the inferior functions.</p>

<p><a id="para_706"></a>706. Capillary arteries in countless numbers
terminate in the tissues in membraneless canals
(304 and 310). Particles of the blood are seen to
quit the arterial stream and to enter into the tissues,
becoming a component part of them: other particles
are seen to quit the tissues and to enter the current
of the blood. The latter are probably organic
particles, to which a certain degree of elaboration
has been already given, now transmitted to the
capillary veins, to be carried back to the lungs to
undergo there a further depuration, fitting them
on their return to the system for a higher organization.</p>

<p><a id="para_707"></a>707. Thus the lymphatic vessels, analogous in
so many other respects to the veins, are probably
similar to them in this also—that they take up from
the tissues particles already organized, in order to
submit them to processes which communicate to
them a progressively higher organization. The
notion that the contents of the lymphatics consist
of worn-out particles, capable of accomplishing no
further purpose in the economy, is not tenable:—</p>

<p>1. Because it is not analogous to the ordinary
operations of nature to mix wholly excrementitious
matter with a substance for the production, ela<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>boration,
and perfection of which, she has constructed
such an expensive apparatus.</p>

<p>2. Because, on the other hand, the admixture
of matter already highly animalized with matter,
as yet but imperfectly animalized, exalts the
nature of the latter, and is conducive to its complete
animalization.</p>

<p>3. Because the lymph, almost wholly albuminous,
is already closely allied in nature to the
blood; it is, therefore, reasonable to infer, that it
is matter passing through an advancing stage of
purification and exaltation.</p>

<p>4. Because this plan of progressive organization
is in harmony with the ordinary operations of
nature, in which there is traceable a successive
ascent from the low to the high, the former being
preparatory and necessary to the latter. The
tender and delicate organs of animal life, the brain,
the nerves, the apparatus of sense, the muscles,
inasmuch as they perform the highest functions,
probably require to be constructed of a more highly
organized material, for the production of which
the matter primarily derived from crude aliment
is subjected to different processes, rising one above
the other in delicacy and refinement; by each of
which it is made successively more and more
perfect, until it acquires the highest qualities of
living substance, and is capable of becoming the
instrument of performing its most exalted functions.</p>

<p><a id="para_708"></a>708. Secretion is the function by which a substance,
gaseous, liquid, or solid, is separated or formed
from the nutritive fluid. It is a function as necessary
to the plant as to the animal, and indispensable
alike to the life of both. It is of equal importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
to the preservation of the individual and to the
perpetuation of the species. In all living beings
secretions are separated from the nutritive fluid,
and added to the aliment to assist in converting it
into nutriment, and are separated from the nutriment
to maintain the composition of the nutritive
mass in a state fit for the continued performance
of the act of nutrition, and to form the germ on
the development of which the continuance of the
species depends.</p>

<p><a id="para_709"></a>709. The secretions of the plant, varied and abundant,
are indispensable to its nourishment, growth,
and fructification. The secretions of the animal
more diversified, and far more constantly performed,
increase in number and elaborateness in proportion
to the range and intensity of the vital endowments
and actions. In all animals high in the scale of
organization, and especially in man, the products
of secretion are vast in number, and exceedingly
complex in nature,—membrane, muscle, brain,
bone;—the skin, the fat, the nail, the hair;—water,
milk, bile, wax, saliva, gastric juice;—whatever
substances enter as constituents into the corporeal
structure;—whatever substances are specially
produced, in order to perform some definite purpose
in the economy;—whatever substances are
separated from the mass, and carried out of the
system on account of their useless or noxious properties:—all
are derived from the nutritive fluid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the blood, and are formed from it by the process
of secretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_710"></a>710. In this function are included the most
secret and subtle processes of the vital economy,—the
ultimate actions of the organic life. Of the real
nature of those actions nothing definite is known;
and they are modified by agencies over which the
art and skill of the experimentalist can exert no
adequate control. It is not wonderful therefore
that they should be involved in obscurity: nevertheless,
when all the phenomena are collected and
compared, much of the mysteriousness in which
the function appears at first view to be involved
vanishes.</p>

<p><a id="para_711"></a>711. The apparatus of secretion is infinity varied
in form: when examined in its complex combinations
it appears inextricable in structure, but the
diligence and skill of modern research have unfolded
much of its mechanism, and enabled us to
trace the successive steps by which it passes from
its simple to its complex condition.</p>

<p><a id="para_712"></a>712. To form an organ of secretion there must be
an artery, a vein, a nerve, an absorbent, and a sufficient
quantity of cellular tissue to allow of the free
expansion of these vessels and of their complete
intercommunication. Membrane constitutes such
an organ; for membrane is composed of arteries,
veins, nerves, and absorbents sustained and connected
by cellular tissue. Hence membrane con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>stitutes
a secreting organ, in its simplest form.
The most important secreting membranes are the
serous (30), the cutaneous (34), and the mucous
(33).</p>

<p><a id="para_713"></a>713. Serous membrane which lines the great
cavities of the body, and which gives an external
covering to the organs contained in them (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span>
a, c), forms an extensive secreting surface. Synovial
membrane, or that which covers the internal
surface of joints, and which constitutes an important
portion of the apparatus of locomotion, is
essentially the same in structure and office.</p>

<p><a id="para_714"></a>714. Cutaneous membrane, or the skin, which
forms the external covering of the body, is an organ
in which manifold secretions are constantly elaborated;
but the skin is only a modification of the
membrane which lines the interior of the body,
the mucous. Mucous membrane forms the basis
of the secreting apparatus placed in the mouth,
fauces, esophagus, stomach, and intestines in their
whole extent; of the secreting apparatus auxiliary
to that of the alimentary canal, namely, the pancreas
and the liver; probably also of the mesenteric,
or lacteal glands, together with the vast
system of lymphatic glands, and certainly of the
glands of the larynx, trachea, bronchi and air
vesicles of the lungs. Hence, while membrane
forms the basis of the secreting apparatus in general,
mucous membrane is far more extensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
employed in its construction than any other form
of membrane.</p>

<p><a id="para_715"></a>715. 1. In the construction of the secreting apparatus,
membrane disposed in the simplest form,
constitutes merely a uniform, smooth, extended
surface. Serous membrane is always disposed in
this simple mode. The costal pleura which lines
the internal surface of the walls of the chest
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span> a); the pulmonary pleura which is
continued from the walls of the chest over the
lungs (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span> 5); the peritoneum which lines the
internal surface of the cavity of the abdomen, and
which is reflected over the viscera contained in it
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">LX.</span> c, and 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.); the synovial membrane
which covers all the articular surfaces; the
arachnoid membrane which envelopes the brain,
form simple continuous, serous, secreting surfaces.
On the contrary, mucous membrane is never dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>posed
in this perfectly simple mode; even when
it forms a continuous surface, as in the lining,
which it affords to the alimentary canals, it is more
or less plaited into folds or rugæ (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXVII">CLXVII</a></span>. 1).</p>

<p><a id="para_716"></a>716. 2. The second disposition of membrane in
the construction of the secreting apparatus, is the
depression of it into a minute pit or fova, called a
crypt (<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXI">CLXXXI</a>. </span>), which is sometimes inclosed on
all sides, forming a cell or vesicle (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a>.</span>).</p>

<p><a id="para_717"></a>717. 3. Next, the vesicle, instead of being
rounded, is elongated into a peduncle or neck, not
unlike the neck of a bottle (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXII">CLXXXII</a>.</span> 1). This
pedunculated vesicle is called a follicle.</p>

<p><a id="para_718"></a>718. 4. Then, the follicle is somewhat elongated,
without neck and without terminal expansion
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a>.</span> 1); and this is called a cæcum or
pouch.</p>

<p><a id="para_719"></a>719. 5. And, lastly, the cæcum itself is elon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>gated;
so that instead of presenting the appearance
of a pouch, it rather resembles a tube (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXV">CLXXXV</a></span>. 1), and is accordingly named tubulum.</p>

<p><a id="para_720"></a>720. In the construction of the secreting apparatus,
membrane, then, may be said to be disposed
into four elementary forms constituting cryptæ or
vesicles, follicles, cæca and tubuli. Membrane,
disposed into these elementary forms, constitutes
the simple bodies by the accumulation and the
varied arrangement of which the compound organs
are composed. There is no other known element
which enters into the composition of the most
complex secreting organ.</p>

<p><a id="para_721"></a>721. One of these elementary bodies may exist
as a simple organ, or many may be collected into a
mass to form a compound organ. When single
they are called solitary: when collected into a
mass, aggregated. Each elementary body has a
mode of aggregation peculiar to itself. Vesicles
aggregate by clustering together (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a></span>.),
and adhering as if by a common stem (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXXXVIII">CXXXVIII</a></span>.); follicles by uniting at their orifices
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIII">CLXXXIII</a></span>.), and forming masses which are
disposed either in a linear direction (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIII">CLXXXIII</a></span>.)
or in fasciculi (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIV">CLXXXIV</a></span>.); cæca by forming
bundles, parallel or branched (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>.); and
tubuli by forming masses straight (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXV">CLXXXV</a></span>.),
tortuous or convoluted (figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXV">CLXXXV</a></span>. and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIX">CLXXXIX</a></span>.).</p>

<p class="center"><small>Conglomerated follicles.</small></p></div>

<p><a id="para_722"></a>722. When a single elementary body, as a vesicle
or follicle, forms a distinct secreting organ, the
matter secreted is elaborated at the inner surface of
the organ (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXII">CLXXXII</a></span>. 2), and is contained within
its cavity. When needed it quits this cavity
through the walls of the vesicle, or at the orifice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
the follicle, on the application of the appropriate
stimulus. When a number of cryptæ or vesicles are
aggregated into clusters, the individual vesicles
sometimes open by distinct orifices into a common
receptacle or sac (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIV">CLXXXIV</a></span>.). When follicles
are aggregated into a mass, and the mass is disposed
in a linear direction (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIII">CLXXXIII</a></span>.), each
follicle pours out its secreted matter by its own
orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIII">CLXXXIII</a></span>.); but if conglomerated, into a
common mass by a common orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIV">CLXXXIV</a></span>.).</p>

<p><a id="para_723"></a>723. In like manner, in some very simple arrangements
of cæca and tubuli, each body opens by its
own distinct orifice (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXV">CLXXXV</a></span>. 2). But in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
more complex arrangements of these bodies, it is
indispensably necessary to modify this mode of
parting with their contents. When the elementary
bodies are aggregated into dense, thick masses (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIX">CLXXXIX</a></span>.), when layer after layer of these masses
containing myriads of myriads of follicles, cæca, or
tubuli, are superimposed one upon another, (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXIX">CLXXXIX</a></span>.), it is impossible that each individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
body can have a separate orifice. In this case a minute
tube springs from each body (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>. 2); and
a complete connexion is established between all the
individuals composing the mass by the free intercommunication
of these tubes (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>. 2).
Of these tubes the minutest unite together, and form
larger branches (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>. 2); these larger
branches again uniting form still larger branches
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>. 2), until, by their successive union,
the branches form at length a single trunk (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVI">CLXXXVI</a></span>. 3), with which all the individual branches,
whether great or small, communicate, and into
which they all pour their contents (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXII">CLXXXII</a></span>.
2, 3). The bodies from which these tubes take
their origin, and the minute tubes themselves, are
called secreting canals (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXII">CLXXXII</a></span>. 1, 2); the
common trunk formed by their union is termed the
excretory duct (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXII">CLXXXII</a></span>. 3). The secreting
canals contain the secreted matter; the excretory
duct collects this matter, and conveys it to the
part of the body in which it is appropriated to the
specific purpose which it serves in the economy.</p>

<p><a id="para_724"></a>724. The basis of the secreting canals consists,
then, of membrane disposed in one or other of the
elementary forms described (712, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), These
secreting canals constitute a peculiar system of
organs wholly different from all the other organs of
the body. The form of these organs, their structure
and their relation to the blood-vessels and nerves,
have formed subjects of laborious investigation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of keen controversy during several centuries. The
honour of discovering the exact truth on these
points is due to very recent researches.</p>

<p><a id="para_725"></a>725. Malpighi, an Italian, who flourished at
Bologna in the middle of the 17th century, was the
first to establish a special inquiry into the intimate
structure of the secreting apparatus. After many
years of laborious examination he arrived at the
conclusion that a minute sac or follicle is invariably
interposed between the termination of the capillary
artery and the commencement of the excretory
duct. According to him, the capillary artery conveys
the blood to the follicle, separates from the
blood the substance secreted, and the excretory
duct arising from one extremity of the follicle conveys
the secreted fluid, when duly prepared, to its
destined situation. By injection, by dissection, by
the microscope, by experiment on living animals,
and by the phenomena of disease, he conceived
that he had demonstrated that this is the true
structure of the secreting apparatus in its most
complex form. This view was generally acquiesced
in by his contemporaries and by succeeding anatomists
and physiologists; and in the time when
Ruysh wrote was the received opinion.</p>

<p><a id="para_726"></a>726. Ruysh, who flourished at Amsterdam,
and was contemporary with Malpighi, but a
younger man, and who published on the glands
about twenty years after Malpighi, according to
the account of Haller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> “employed wonderful patience,
with the assistance of his daughters, in
rendering all his preparations elegant and beautiful,
being equally skilled in the methods of
softening, hardening, filling, and drying.” Of
Ruysh it was said that while others, in their
anatomical preparations, merely exhibited the
horrid features of death, he preserved the human
body in all the freshness of life, even to the
expression of the features. The fineness of his
injections, the dexterity with which he unfolded
the minute vessels, nerves, and absorbents, and
exhibited their combinations and relations in the
most delicate structures, the skill with which he
preserved his preparations in transparent fluids,
and the elegance with which he displayed them in
their natural forms and folds, excited universal
admiration; and philosophers, statesmen, princes,
kings, all the learned and noble of the day,
crowded to his museum.</p>

<p><a id="para_727"></a>727. By his superior method of injecting, Ruysh
conceived that he was able completely to disprove
Malpighi’s doctrine. He maintained that the
bodies which Malpighi mistook for sacs or follicles
are in reality convoluted vessels; that these
vessels are capable of being completely unravelled;
that, when unfolded, their continuity with the
excretory duct is perfectly demonstrated; that
secretion is performed by the capillary artery
itself, without the intervention of any other organ;
and that when the secreted substance is duly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
prepared, it is poured by the capillary directly
into the excretory duct.</p>

<p><a id="para_728"></a>728. Modern research has demonstrated that the
opinion of Malpighi approaches nearer the truth
than that of Ruysh, who appears to have mistaken
the secreting canals for the ultimate division of
the arterial vessels. Malpighi, indeed, did not
succeed in discovering the elementary bodies of
which the secreting apparatus is composed; but
he arrived at the very verge of the truth. Profiting
by the art which Ruysh brought to so much
perfection, by the facts which Malpighi disclosed,
and, above all, by the improved structure of the
microscope, and the increased skill which has been
acquired in the manipulation of the instrument,
the modern physiologist is enabled to see what
was formerly beyond the cognizance of sense, and
to demonstrate what before could only be matter
of conjecture. Availing himself of these advantages
with consummate skill, and applying himself
to the task with indefatigable industry, Professor
Müller, of Berlin, has investigated the structure
of the secreting apparatus in the whole animal
kingdom, and has traced the progressive development
of the several secreting organs through the
entire animal series, from their simplest form in
the lowest animal, to their most complex in the
highest.</p>

<p><a id="para_729"></a>729. From the researches of this physiologist,
and from the labours of others, his countrymen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
contemporaries, who have engaged in the investigation
with an ardour second only to his own, it is
demonstrated that the secreting apparatus of the
animal body is disposed in one or other of the elementary
forms which have been described. The
blood-vessels are distributed upon the walls of
these elementary bodies, whether simple cryptæ
follicles, cæca, or tubuli, or whether these bodies
are accumulated and combined into the largest
and most complex series of secreting canals, just
as the branches of the pulmonary artery are distributed
upon the walls of the air-vesicles in the rete
mirabile of the lungs. The air-vesicles of the
lungs are secreting organs, and afford an excellent
example of the mode in which the blood-vessels
are distributed upon the walls of the elementary
secreting bodies. The arteries do not form continuous
tubes with the secreting bodies or their excretory
ducts, as was maintained by Ruysh; neither
is the secreting body interposed between the
termination of the artery and the commencement
of the excretory duct, as was thought by Malpighi;
but the ultimate divisions of the arteries are spread
out upon the walls of the secreting bodies, where
they terminate in veins by a delicate vascular net-work
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVII">CLXXXVII</a></span>. 2). The minutest branch of
the artery is always smaller than the minutest secreting
body on the walls of which it is distributed.
According to Müller, the arteries, spread out upon
the walls of the secreting bodies, form a distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and peculiar system of vessels visible under the
microscope. In the more complex secreting
organs, immediately before reaching their distribution
upon the walls of the secreting canals, the
ultimate divisions of the arteries form an intricate
and delicate net-work (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXXVII">CLXXXVII</a></span>. 2). When
at length they reach the secreting canals the arteries
no longer divide and subdivide, but are always
of the same uniform size in the same secreting
organ, though their magnitude is different in
every different kind of secreting organ. These
ultimate divisions of the arteries are the proper
capillary arteries. It is in these arteries that the
changes are wrought upon the blood which it is
the object of the various processes of secretion to
effect. In the walls of these arteries there are
visible no pores, no apertures, no open extremities
by which the secreted fluid, when formed from the
blood, is conveyed into the cavity of the secreting
canals; it probably passes through the walls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the vessels into the secreting canals by the process
of endosmose (<a href="#para_804">804</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_730"></a>730. Secreting organs are very abundantly supplied
with nerves, which are derived for the most
part from the organic portion of the nervous system;
although for the reasons assigned (vol. i. p. 77, <i lang="la">et
seq.</i>) sentient nerves are mixed with the organic.
The more important secreting organs have each a
distinct net-work or plexus of organic nerves, which
surround the blood-vessels distributed to the organ,
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 3), and which envelopes more especially
the arterial trunks and their larger branches
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 3). From these plexuses nervous filaments
spring in countless numbers (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 3),
which are spread out upon the walls of the arteries,
just as the arteries are spread out upon the walls
of the secreting canals. The nerves never quit
the arteries; are never spent upon the membranous
matter which forms the basis of the
secreting organ, but are lost upon the walls of
the capillary arteries. The nerves uniformly increase
in number and size as the arteries diminish
in magnitude and as their capillary terminations
become thinner and thinner.</p>

<p><a id="para_731"></a>731. When the secreting apparatus consists of
simply extended membrane, a close net-work of
capillary arteries with their accompanying nerves
is spread out over the whole extent of the secreting
surface. This simple arrangement is sufficient
to separate from the blood the simple secretion in
this case required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p><a id="para_732"></a>732. When the secreting apparatus consists of
simple cryptæ, follicles, cæca, or tubuli, a similar
net-work of capillary arteries and nerves is spread
out on the sides of this more extended surface.
The more elaborate secretion now formed is received
into the interior of these organs, where it remains
for some time, and whence it is ultimately conveyed
as it is needed by the actions of the system.</p>

<p><a id="para_733"></a>733. But when the secreting apparatus consists
of aggregates of cryptæ, follicles, cæca, and tubuli,
with their net-works of arteries and nerves, a much
more complex structure is built up, which is
destined to perform a proportionably elaborate
function. An aggregation of these secreting
bodies into a large mass, enveloped in a common
membrane, so as to form a distinct body of a solid
consistence, constitutes the organ termed a gland.
Simply extended membrane, with its apparatus of
arteries and nerves does not constitute a gland.
Simple cryptæ, follicles, cæca, and tubuli, with
their larger apparatus of arteries and nerves, do not
constitute a gland. The first is simply secreting
surface; the second are simply secreting cryptæ,
follicles, cæca or tubuli; but when these bodies
are aggregated into dense and solid masses with
an extended system of excretory ducts, and when
the whole of this apparatus is inclosed in a proper
membrane so as to form a distinct body, such a
body is termed a gland.</p>

<p><a id="para_734"></a>734. Primary aggregations of these secreting
bodies constitute what is termed a conglobate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
that is, a simple gland; such are all the glands
connected with the absorbent or lymphatic system.
Secondary aggregates, or aggregates composed of
simple glands, constitute what is termed a conglomerate,
that is, a compound gland; such are all
the organs commonly termed viscera, as the liver,
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidney, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="para_735"></a>735. The conglobate, or simple gland, being
formed by the aggregation of cryptæ, follicles, cæca,
or tubuli, inclosed in a proper membrane, presents
the appearance of a simple solid body, commonly
of a rounded or oblong form (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVI">CLXXVI</a>.</span> 516).
On the contrary, the conglomerate or compound
gland, being formed by the aggregation of conglobate
or simple glands, presents the appearance of a
compound body composed of a congeries of masses
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXV">CLXV</a>.</span> 1). The larger masses enveloped in
their own proper membrane are termed lobes
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCI">CXCI</a>.</span>); the smaller masses, also enveloped in
their own proper membrane, are termed lobules
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCI">CXCI</a>.</span>); the lobules, when carefully examined,
are seen to be composed of still smaller
masses, and these of masses yet more minute,
until at length patient, laborious, and skilful dissection
brings into view the ultimate constituent
elements, which are invariably found to consist of
simple cryptæ, follicles, cæca, or tubuli.</p>

<p><a id="para_736"></a>736. Thus membrane having a specific arrangement
of blood-vessels and nerves, from being simply
extended, is folded into a few elementary forms;
the bodies which result constitute simple secreting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
organs; these bodies collected together form, by
their aggregation, compound organs; the compound
organs, uniting, form aggregates still more
compound, until at length a structure is built up
highly elaborate and complex. But this complexity
of combination and arrangement does not alter
the constitution of the organs; their form varies,
but their nature remains essentially the same. All
consist alike of membrane organized in a similar
mode. The complex contains no element not possessed
by the simple gland, and the gland contains
no element not possessed by the secreting surface.
But there is this difference in the complex organs.
Every kind and degree of change in the form of
the secreting apparatus, from membrane simply
extended, to membrane coiled up into the most
complex gland, is attended with an accumulation
and concentration of secreting surface. The crypt
contains a larger extent of secreting surface than
the simple membrane; the follicle than the crypt;
the cæcum than the follicle; and the tubulum than
the cæcum. A certain amount of secreting surface
is gained by the disposition of the simple membrane
into the form of the crypt. The collection
of a number of crypts into a cluster doubles the
extent of the secreting surface by the extent of
every crypt that is added to the cluster. The
addition of every cluster doubles the whole extent
of surface acquired by a single cluster. But when
stems spring as if from a common trunk; when
branches spring from a stem; when small branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
spring from the large branches, and yet smaller
branches from the small in a series, which the eye,
assisted by the most powerful microscope, is wholly
unable to trace; when all the clusters thus formed
are collected, and combined into a compact mass,
the intricacy of which no art can completely unravel,
the extent of surface obtained is altogether immeasurable.
How immense must be the extent of
surface thus acquired in such an organ as the
human lungs, in such a gland as the human
liver!</p>

<p><a id="para_737"></a>737. In such an aggregation the concentration is
also equal to the accumulation; the maximum of
surface is comprised in the minimum of space, and
the energy and elaborateness of the function of a
secreting organ is uniformly proportionate to such
a concentration of its secreting substance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CLXXXVIII"></a>Fig. CLXXXVIII.</div>

<blockquote>

<p><a id="para_738"></a>738. Hence the complexity of the compound
gland in the higher animals would appear to arise
solely from the intricate arrangement of the immense
mass of secreting matter concentrated in a small
compass; hence also the progressively increased
complication indicated in the successive development
of the glandular system in the animal series.
Thus, for example, among the distinct organs
formed for the purpose of elaborating a specific
secretion, being intimately connected with the
process of digestion, one of the first is the salivary
gland. Low down in the scale, in the animal in
which the first rudiment of a salivary gland is
traceable, it consists of a single follicle, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
appears to serve the office of a gland. In an
animal a little higher in structure, two, three, or
four follicles combine to form a somewhat less
simple organ. In an animal still higher in the
series, a number of follicles are clustered together
and form a much more complex organ; and in this
manner, as the organization of the animal becomes
higher and higher, the complexity of the gland
increases, until at length it is composed of a countless
number of follicles collected into clusters, the
clusters disposed into lobes, the lobes subdivided
into lobules, and the lobules into still smaller particles,
the ultimate elements of the glandular apparatus.
In like manner, when the first rudiment
of the liver is discoverable, it consists of a single
pouch or cæcum; somewhat higher in the series,
the organ is composed of two or more cæca distinct
and free; and then, as its complexity increases
with the perfection of the organization, cæca are
accumulated upon cæca; the aggregates so formed
are closely compacted, disposed into lobes, divided
into lobules, and subdivided into the ultimate particles
of the glandular apparatus. So in a gland
composed of tubuli, as the kidney, the organ in its
rudimentary state consists of a few straight tubuli:
as its structure advances more tubuli are added:
next, the increasing tubuli superimposed one upon
another become tortuous; then the tubuli still
accumulating, become not merely tortuous, but convoluted;
and last of all, countless numbers of
tubuli are closely compacted into exceedingly con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>voluted
masses. Uniformly, the lower the animal
and the simpler the organ, the larger and the more
manifest are the elementary parts of the gland;
but in the higher animals these elementary bodies
are so minute as to be altogether microscopical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
and their arrangement is so complex that it can
be unravelled only with extreme difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

</blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_739"></a>739. It is a striking confirmation of the correctness
of this view of the structure of the glandular
apparatus, that whenever in the ascending series
a gland appears for the first time in any class, the
elementary bodies are so large, and are disposed in
so simple a mode, that a slight examination is
sufficient to demonstrate their primitive form, and
to render it manifest that they consist either of
vesicles, follicles, cæca, or tubuli, more or less
aggregated. This is seen in the obvious structure
presented by the liver, the pancreas, the salivary
glands, and the mammæ, in the simple animals in
which these organs first appear. Thus the liver
in animals low down in the scale is manifestly
composed of simple clustering follicles: in the
fish the pancreas is composed of simple branched
follicles: in the bird, the salivary glands are composed
of simple parallel tubuli; and in the cetacea
the breasts are composed of simple branched
tubuli.</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_740"></a>740. But the microscope, by bringing the successive
development of the compound gland in the
embryo of the higher animal under the cognizance of
sense, perfectly discloses the nature of its composi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>tion.
In the development of the incubated egg every
step of the progressive formation of the compound
gland is rendered visible to the eye. When this process
is carefully watched, it is seen that the part of
the gland first formed is the excretory duct, which
springs from the blastema, the common mass of
matter out of which all the organs are formed.
From this duct the elementary parts of the gland
bud just as bunches of grapes bud from the stalk.
The buds, at first at considerable distances from
each other, approach nearer as they increase by
new growths, until at length they come into actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
contact. The growth continuing, and the compactness
of the substance of the gland proportionally
increasing, the primitive form of the elementary
bodies which compose it is ultimately lost. The
substance of the gland now appears to consist of
compact solid matter, which is commonly termed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
parenchyma. The component particles of this
parenchymatous and apparently solid substance
present a clustered or grape-like appearance, from
which they early obtained the name of acini, from
the Latin word acinus, a berry. This term, originally
employed merely to express the clustered
and branching appearance of the elementary parts
of the gland, has since been used in widely different
senses. By some it has been employed to
express solid glandular grains constituting a supposed
distinct parenchymatous substance, differing
in every different gland. It is now proved that no
such solid granular particles enter into the composition
of any gland in the animal kingdom. By
others the term acini has been employed to express
granular bodies composed of blood-vessels, directly
continuous with the excretory ducts, and from
which the excretory ducts derive their origin.
Recent investigation has demonstrated that there is
no continuity of the blood-vessels into the excretory
duct either in the acini or in any other part
of the gland. It is established that the blood-vessels
are spread out upon the walls of the secreting
canals and do not form with them continuous
tubes. The bodies which have been mistaken
for granular particles, constituting the so
called solid acini, are really the shut extremities
of hollow follicles, cæca, or tubuli, which appear
solid only from the closeness with which they are
compacted. When carefully dissected and ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>amined
under the microscope, their real nature
becomes apparent, and this is also sometimes
capable of being demonstrated by injection; for
some of these elementary bodies are vesicular, and
can be filled with mercury, when they present a
beautiful appearance like clusters of diamonds; or
they may be inflated with air, just as the air vesicles
of the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="para_741"></a>741. On watching the formation of the gland
in the development of the embryo, it would appear
that at first free streams of blood, or blood not
contained in proper vessels, pass around the acini,
the shut extremities of the excretory ducts, or the
secreting canals. “So it would seem,” says
Müller, “when we examine the evolution of the
liver and kidney in the embryo of the lower animal;
for the interstices of the canals appear bloody,
without the slightest trace of the walls of blood-vessels.
I conceive that in the beginning new
streams arise in an amorphous mass (a mass
without form), not bounded by proper parieties;
but that soon walls are formed, which present
definite boundaries to the streams, the density of
the substance around the streams gradually increasing.”
It is in this manner that the connexion
is first established between the system of
capillary blood-vessels and that of the secreting
organs.</p>

<p><a id="para_742"></a>742. In its embryo state the compound gland of
the highest animal consists of mere excretory ducts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
wonderfully similar to the simple secreting bodies
of the lowest classes. But in the higher animal
this simple form of the gland is transient: gradually,
with the progressive evolution of the
embryo, it passes into a more complex structure;
while in the lower animal the simple form of the
gland remains permanently the same through the
whole term of life.</p>

<p><a id="para_743"></a>743. Such are the main points which have been
ascertained relative to the structure of the secreting
apparatus, which enters in one or other of its
forms, as a constituent element, into almost every
part of the animal body. Wherever there is
nutrition there is secretion, and wherever there is
secretion there is one or other of these secreting
bodies. How immense the number of these organs
in the human body! Every point in the interior
of the walls that bound the great cavities is a
secreting surface. Every point of the secreting
surface that lines the alimentary canal, from its
commencement to its termination, is studded with
distinct secreting organs. Every point of the
skin is still more thickly studded with distinct
secreting organs. By the naked eye, and still
more distinctly with a lens, may be seen the pores
through which the vapour that constitutes the insensible
perspiration incessantly exudes. Next
are the open mouths of myriads of sebacious
follicles that pour out upon the skin the oily
matter which gives it its suppleness and softness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
and besides all these, are the hairs, each the product
of a secreting organ placed immediately
beneath the skin. An attempt to count the number
of pores and hairs visible to the eye within
the compass of an inch, and thence to compute
the number on the whole surface of the skin, may
convey some conception of the amount of these
organs; yet these form but a small part of the
secreting apparatus. The great viscera of the
body, the brain, the lungs, the liver, the pancreas,
the spleen, are portions of it; all the organs of
the senses, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue;
all the organs of locomotion; every point of the
surface of every muscle, and a great part of the
surface and substance of the very bones are
crowded with secreting organs.</p>

<p><a id="para_744"></a>744. Since every secreting organ is copiously
supplied with blood, it follows that a great part of
the blood of the body is always circulating in
secreting organs; and, indeed, it is to afford materials
for the action of these organs that the
blood itself is formed.</p>

<p><a id="para_745"></a>745. How do these organs act upon the blood?
All that is known of the course of that portion
of the blood which flows through an organ of
secretion is, that it passes into arteries of extreme
minuteness, which are spread out upon the external
walls of the elementary secreting bodies,
and which, as far as they can be traced, pass into
capillary veins,—nowhere terminating by open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
mouths—nowhere presenting visible outlets or
pores; their contents probably transuding through
their thin and tender coats by the process of endosmose.</p>

<p><a id="para_746"></a>746. As it is flowing through these capillary
arteries, the blood undergoes the transformations
effected by secretion, forming—1. The fluids, which
are added to the aliment, and which accomplish its
solution, and change it into chyme. 2. The fluids,
which are added to the chyme to convert it into
chyle, and both to chyle and lymph, to assist in
their assimilation. 3. The fluids which, poured
into the cavities, facilitate automatic or voluntary
movements. 4. The fluids, which serve as the
media to the organs of the senses by which external
objects are conveyed to the sentient extremities
of the nerves for their excitement. 5. The
fluids which, deposited at different points of the
cellular tissue, when more aliment is received than
is needed, serve as reservoirs of nutriment to be
absorbed when more aliment is required than can
be afforded by the digestive organs. 6. The fluids
which are subsequently to be converted into solids.
7. The fluids which are eliminated from the common
mass, whether of fluids or solids, to be carried
out of the system as excrementitious substances.
8. In addition to all these substances, which are
indispensable to the preservation of the individual,
those which are necessary to the perpetuation
of the species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p><a id="para_747"></a>747. In order to form any conception of the mode
in which the secreting organs act upon the blood, so
as to elaborate from it such diversified substances,
it is necessary to consider the chemical composition
of the different products of secretion, and
the degrees in which they really differ from each
other, and form the common mass of blood out of
which they are eliminated.</p>

<p><a id="para_748"></a>748. By chemical analysis, it is established that
all the substances which are formed from the blood
by the process of secretion are either water, albumen,
mucus, jelly, fibrin, oil, resin, or salts; and,
consequently, that all the secretions are either
aqueous, albuminous, mucous, gelatinous, fibrinous,
resinous, oleaginous, or saline.</p>

<p><a id="para_749"></a>749. 1. <span class="smcap">Aqueous Secretions.</span>—From the entire
surface of the skin, and also from that of the
lungs, there is constantly poured a quantity of
water, derived from the blood, mixed with some
animal matters, which, however, are so minute in
quantity, that they do not communicate to the
aqueous fluid any specific character.</p>

<p><a id="para_750"></a>750. 2. <span class="smcap">Albuminous Secretions.</span>—All the
close cavities, as the thorax, the abdomen, the pericardium,
the ventricles of the brain, and even the
interstices of the cellular tissue, are constantly
moistened by a fluid which is termed serous, because
it is derived from the serum of the blood.
This serous fluid consists of albumen in a fluid
form, and it differs from the serum of the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
chiefly in containing in equal volumes a smaller
proportion of albumen. Membranes of all kinds
consist essentially of coagulated albumen; and
the albumen, as constituting these tissues, differs
from albumen as existing in the serum of the
blood only in being unmixed with extraneous
matter, and in being in a solid form.</p>

<p><a id="para_751"></a>751. 3. <span class="smcap">Mucous Secretions.</span>—As all the close
cavities, or those which are protected from the external
air, are moistened with a serous fluid, so
all the surfaces which are exposed to the external
air, as the mouth, the nostrils, the air-passages,
and the whole extent of the alimentary canal, are
moistened with a mucous fluid. Mucus does not
exist already formed in the blood. It is always
the product of a gland. Some of the mucous
glands are among the most elaborate of the body;
still the main action of the gland seems to be to
coagulate the albumen of the blood, for the basis
of mucous is coagulated albumen. The fluid that
lubricates the mucous surfaces in their whole extent,
the saliva, the gastric juice, the tears, the
essential part of the fluid formed in the testes and
in the ovaria, are mucous secretions. Hence the
most complex and elaborate functions of the body,
respiration, digestion, reproduction, are intimately
connected with the mucous secretions: nevertheless,
as far as regards their chemical nature, the
mucous differ but slightly from the albuminous
secretions; and it is probable that a slight change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
in the secreting organ is sufficient to convert the
one into the other. By the irritation of mercury
on the salivary glands, the saliva, properly of a
mucous, is sometimes converted into a substance
of an albuminous nature; and irritation in some
of the serous membranes occasionally causes them
to secrete a mucous fluid.</p>

<p><a id="para_752"></a>752. 4. <span class="smcap">Gelatinous Secretions.</span>—The proximate
principle termed jelly abounds plentifully in
several of the solids of the body, and more especially
in the skin; but jelly does not exist already
formed in the blood. Yet it is not the product of
a gland, neither is there any known organ by
which it is formed. Out of the body albumen is
capable of being converted into jelly by digestion
in dilute nitric acid: this conversion is probably
effected by the addition of a portion of oxygen to
the albumen. Albumen contains more carbon
and less oxygen than jelly; the proportions of
hydrogen and nitrogen in both being nearly the
same. According to MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard,
the elements of albumen and jelly are,</p>

  <td class="tdl">16.988</td>

</table></div>

<p>The conversion of albumen into jelly is incessantly
going on in the system; and the process accomplishes
most extended and important uses. In
the lungs at the moment of inspiration oxygen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
enters into the blood in a state of loose combination;
but in the system, at every point where the
conversion of albumen into jelly takes place,
oxygen probably enters into a state of chemical
combination with albumen; and the new proximate
principle, jelly, is the result. The agent by
which this conversion is effected appears to be
the capillary artery: the primary object of the
action is the production of a material necessary for
the formation of the tissues of which jelly constitutes
the basis, as the skin; but a secondary and
most important object is the production of animal
heat; the carbon that furnishes one material of
the fire being given off by the albumen at the moment
of its transition into jelly; and the oxygen
that furnishes the other material of the fire being
afforded to the blood at the moment of inspiration.
This view affords a beautiful exposition of the
reason why jelly forms so large a constituent of
the skin in all animals. The great combustion of
oxygen and carbon, the main fire that supports
the temperature of the body, is placed where it
is most needed, at the external surface.</p>

<p><a id="para_753"></a>753. 5. <span class="smcap">Fibrinous Secretions.</span>—The pure muscular
fibre, or the basis of the flesh, is identical with
the fibrin of the blood. It contains a larger proportion
of nitrogen, the peculiar animal principle,
and is consequently more highly animalized than
the preceding substances. It appears to be simply
discharged from the circulating blood by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
capillary arteries, and deposited in its appropriate
situation; no material change in its constitution
being, it would seem, necessary to fit it for its
office.</p>

<p><a id="para_754"></a>754. 6. <span class="smcap">Oleagenous Secretions.</span>—Fat of all
kinds, which is found so extensively connected
with the muscles, and with many of the viscera,
and which is more or less diffused through the
whole extent of the cellular tissue, marrow, milk,
and nervous and cerebral matter, are essentially
of the same nature. The basis of them all is oil;
and oil exists already formed both in the chyle
and in the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_755"></a>755. 7. <span class="smcap">Resinous Secretions.</span>—The peculiar
substance forming the basis of bile, picromel;
the peculiar substance forming the basis of urine,
urea; the peculiar substance connected with the
muscular fibre, and forming a component part of
almost all the solids and fluids of the body, osmazome,
consists of a common principle—a resin,
which exists already formed in the blood, and
more especially in the serosity of the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_756"></a>756. 8. <span class="smcap">Saline Secretions.</span>—The substances
termed saline, namely, the acids, the alkalis, and
the neutral and earthy salts, are disposed over every
part of the system: they enter more or less into
all the constituents both of the solids and fluids;
they form more especially the phosphate of lime,
the earthy matter of which bones are composed;
and they all exist already formed in the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p><a id="para_757"></a>757. From this account, then, it appears, that
by chemical analysis, the blood is ascertained
to contain water, albumen, fibrin, oil, resin,
and various saline and earthy substances: it follows,
that, with the exception of the absence of
jelly, the constituents of the body and the constituents
of the blood are nearly identical; and it is
probable that they will be found to be perfectly
identical when their analysis shall have become
complete.</p>

<p><a id="para_758"></a>758. It is also manifest that in by far the greater
number of cases the various substances of which
the body is composed are simply separated from
the nutritive fluid at the parts of the body at
which they are deposited; and that, existing
already formed in the blood, they are merely deposited
there, and not generated. Still, however,
since it is certain that gelatin cannot be recognized
in the blood, and since it is doubtful whether
some other substances found in different textures
and secretions really exist in the blood, it is
necessary, in the present state of our knowledge,
to suppose, that although most of the constituents
of the living tissues are contained in the blood,
yet that in some instances a material change is
effected in their nature at the time and place of
their escape from the circulation; and that in
these cases the secreted substances are not simple
extracts from, but products of, the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_759"></a>759. It is by the apparatus of secretion that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
separation, evolution, or re-formation, is effected.
Out of a fluid which contains, blended together,
almost all the heterogeneous substances of which
the body is built up, particular substances are
selected from the common mass, and are deposited
in certain parts, and only in certain parts. Although
by the most careful examination of the
structure of the apparatus, it is not possible to
form a precise conception of the mode in which
this separation is effected, yet we are enabled to
perceive a number of contrivances which we can
readily understand must conduce to the accomplishment
of the object.</p>

<p><a id="para_760"></a>760. 1. Of these, the most obvious is mechanical
arrangement.</p>

<p><a id="para_761"></a>761. In its passage to different organs the blood
is propelled through canals of extreme minuteness:
in every different case these canals differ from
each other in size; pass off from their respective
trunks at different angles; possess different
degrees of density; are variously contorted, and
are of various lengths. In some they are straight,
in others convoluted; at one time branching, at
another pencillated, and at another starry. The
veins, too, in some cases, are almost straight, in
others exceedingly tortuous, in others reticulated;
and the freedom of their communication with the
arteries varies so much, that in some cases fine
injections pass from the one set of vessels to the
other with the greatest facility, while, in others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
they pass with extreme difficulty. The consequence
of these divers arrangements of the capillary
blood-vessels is, that the current of the blood
must necessarily flow in them with different
degrees of velocity; its particles must be placed
at different distances from each other, and must
be presented to each other in different positions
and in widely different proportions. In no two
secreting organs are any two of these conditions
exactly alike. In the lower orders of animals, in
which secretion is seen in its simplest condition,
the general nutritive fluid, elaborated and contained
in a single internal cavity, appears to furnish
a variety of products very different from itself,
by a process hardly more complex than mere
transudation through a living membrane. In the
higher animals the different secreting organs may
be considered, in part at least, as mechanical contrivances
adapted to carry on analogous transudations—fine
sieves or strainers diversly constructed.
A fluid containing such heterogeneous matters as
the blood, held in combination by so slight an
affinity, slowly transuding through series of tubes,
the mechanical arrangement of which is so varied,
must yield a different substance in every different
case. Thus by simply filtering the blood a vast
variety of products may be obtained, merely in consequence
of a varied disposition of the minute
tubes of which the filters are composed.</p>

<p><a id="para_762"></a>762. 2. But in the second place, this diversity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
of mechanical arrangement is calculated in a high
degree to promote and to modify chemical action.
The contact or proximity of the particles of bodies,
the extent of surface which those particles present
to each other, the space of time in which
they continue in contact, the degree of force
with which they impinge against each other, the
degree of temperature to which they are exposed,—these,
and circumstances such as these, are
conditions which exert the most powerful influence
over chemical decomposition and re-combination.
In the different secreting organs, as has been
shown, the blood must necessarily pass through
vessels having every conceivable diversity of
diameter: in those vessels it must consequently
flow with corresponding differences of velocity.
Some of these diameters will admit one constituent
of the blood, as one of the red particles; others
may be large enough to admit two or more of the
red particles abreast; others may be so small as
to be incapable of admitting a single red particle,
receiving only the more fluid portions of the blood;
in some vessels these different constituents will be
in one degree of proximity, in others in another;
in some they will remain long in contact, in others
only for an instant: it is obvious that from such
different conditions the chemical products may
be infinitely varied.</p>

<p><a id="para_763"></a>763. Such is the composition of chemical bodies,
that a great diversity of substances is obtainable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
merely by changing one condition, the proportions
in which the elementary particles combine.</p>

<p><a id="para_764"></a>764. Oxygen and nitrogen combined in one
proportion form atmospheric air; in another proportion,
nitrous oxide; in another, nitric oxide; in
a fourth, nitrous acid; and in a fifth, nitric acid.
Few secretions formed from the blood differ more
widely from each other than the products thus
formed from these two elementary bodies.</p>

<p><a id="para_765"></a>765. Urea consists of two prime equivalents of
hydrogen, one of carbon, one of oxygen, and one of
nitrogen. Remove one of the atoms of hydrogen,
and take away the atom of nitrogen, urea is converted
into sugar; combine with urea an additional
atom of carbon, it is changed into lithic
acid. In like manner add a small quantity of
water to farina, it is converted into sugar; to fibrin,
it is changed into adipocere. From a reservoir
containing a quantity of substances in the state of
vinous fermentation, draw off portions of the
liquor at different stages of the process, and cause
these to pass through tubes of various diameters
and with various degrees of velocity, there will be
obtained at one time an unfermented syrup, at
another, a fermenting fluid, at another, wine, at
another, vinegar. Out of the body place the blood
in a state of rest, it will spontaneously separate
into serum and crassamentum, and the crassamentum
will further separate into fibrin and red particles.
Add to the serum a certain portion of acid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
it will be coagulated into solid albumen; add to
this solid albumen another portion of acid, it will
be converted into jelly. Add a certain portion of
acid to fibrin, it will be changed into adipose
matter; bring the acid into contact with the red
particles, they will be converted into a substance
closely resembling bile. If by the rough chemistry
which the art of man can conduct so great
a variety of substances may be obtained out of a
single compound, is it not wonderful that a far
greater variety should be produced by the delicate
and subtle chemistry of life.</p>

<p><a id="para_766"></a>766. 3. But a third most important agent in the
process of secretion is some influence derived from
the nervous system.</p>

<p>1. It is proved, by direct experiment, that the
destruction of the nervous apparatus, or of any considerable
portion of it, stops the process of secretion.
By experiments performed by Mr. Brodie, it is
ascertained that the secretion of the urine is suspended
by the removal or destruction of the brain,
though the circulation be maintained in its full
vigour by artificial respiration.</p>

<p>2. The section, and still more the removal, of a
portion of the sentient nerves of the stomach (the
par vagum, or eighth pair), according to some experimentalists,
deranges and impedes; according to
others, totally arrests the process of digestion.</p>

<p>3. Other classes of phenomena illustrate in a
striking manner the influence of the nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
system over the process of secretion. The sight,
nay, even the thought of agreeable food, increases
the secretions of the mouth. Pleasurable ideas
excite, painful ideas destroy, the appetite for food;
probably, in the one case, by increasing, and, in
the other, by suspending the secretion of the gastric
juice: the emotion of grief instantly causes a
flow of tears; that of fear, of urine; the sight or
thought of her child fills the maternal breasts with
milk, while the removal of the child from the
mother diminishes and ultimately stops the secretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_767"></a>767. Even the imagination is capable of exerting
a powerful influence over the process. A female
who had a great aversion to calomel was taking
that medicine in very small doses for some disease
under which she was labouring. Some one told
her that she was taking mercury: immediately she
began to complain of soreness in the mouth;
salivated profusely, and even put on the expression
of countenance peculiar to a salivating person.
On being persuaded that she had been misinformed,
the discharge instantly began to diminish,
and ceased altogether in a single night. Two days
afterwards she was again told, on good authority,
that calomel was contained in her medicines, upon
which the salivation immediately began again, and
was profuse. That this salivation was not produced
by the calomel, but was the effect solely of
the influence of imagination on the salivary glands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
was proved by the absence of redness of the gums,
which always takes place in mercurial salivation,
and also by the absence of the peculiar fætor,
which is characteristic of the action of this metal
on the system.</p>

<p><a id="para_768"></a>768. The same influence is apparent even in the
lower animals: exhibit food to a hungry dog, the
saliva will pour from its mouth. Rob the nest of
the bird of its eggs as soon as they are laid, the
bird may be made to deposit eggs almost without
end, though if the eggs are allowed to remain undisturbed,
it will lay only a certain number. The
bird is led by instinct to continue to deposit eggs
in the nest until a certain number is accumulated;
that is, a mental operation acts upon the ovarium,
the secreting organ in which the eggs are formed,
maintaining it in a state of active secretion for an
indefinite period; whereas without that mental
operation the secretion would be limited to a
definite number.</p>

<p><a id="para_769"></a>769. In all these cases it is probable that the vital
agent by which the effect is produced on the secreting
organs is the organic nerve. Though the
sentient part of the nervous system may in many
cases be the part primarily acted on, yet there is
reason to believe that the ultimate effect is invariably
produced on the organic part, the sentient
nerves in this case acting on the organic, as in
other cases the organic act on the sentient, in consequence
of that intimate connexion which, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the reason assigned (vol. i. p. 79), is established
between both parts of this system. For,</p>

<p><a id="para_770"></a>770. 1. The true object of the sentient part of
the nervous system is to establish a relation between
the body and the external world; the object
of the organic part is to preside over the functions
by which the body is sustained and nourished,
that is, over the processes of secretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_771"></a>771. 2. The nerves which are distributed to the
secreting arteries, and which increase in number
and size as the arteries become capillary, are, for
the most part, derived from the organic portion of
the nervous system (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a>.</span> 3). This anatomical
arrangement clearly points to some physiological
purpose, and indicates the closeness of the relation
between the function of the organic nerve and the
ultimate action of the capillary artery.</p>

<p><a id="para_772"></a>772. 3. It is demonstrated that the sentient part
of the nervous system, though occasionally influencing
and modifying secretion, is not indispensable
to it. In tracing the normal or regular development
of the human fœtus, it is found that the
heart is constructed and is in full action before the
brain and spinal cord, the central masses of the
sentient part of the nervous system, are in existence;
and that these masses are themselves
built up by processes to which the action of the
heart is indispensable; consequently, innumerable
acts of secretion must have taken place, those, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
example, which have been necessary to form the
different substances which enter into the composition
of the heart, before the brain and spinal
cord exist. In like manner in the anormal or
irregular development of the fœtus, as in the production
of monsters, there may be not a vestige of
head, neck, brain or spinal cord, while there may
be a perfect heart, perfect lungs, perfect intestines,
and various portions even of the osseous system.</p>

<p><a id="para_773"></a>773. However in the perfect animal secretion
may be under the influence of the brain and spinal
cord, it is clear that, since the process can go on
without them, it must be independent of them. It
is a false induction from these facts drawn by
some physiologists that secretion is independent of
the nervous system. They do prove that it is
independent of one part of the nervous system,
the sentient; but it does not follow that it is independent
of the other part, the organic.</p>

<p><a id="para_774"></a>774. 4. It is demonstrated that the organic part
of the nervous system is not only independent of the
sentient part, but that it is even pre-existent to it.
Researches into the development of the nervous
system, as shown in the progressive growth of the
fœtus of different animals, have proved that the
existence of the organic nerves is manifest long
before that of the sentient; that nerves are discoverable
in the tissues, before the brain and the
spinal cord are formed; that as these masses
become visible and grow, nerves springing from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
tissues advance towards the central nervous masses,
and at length unite with them; but that this union
does not take place until the development of the
nervous system is considerably advanced. These
curious and most instructive facts show that in the
fœtus, though the brain and spinal cord may
have been destroyed or have been non-existent,
yet that the organic nerves may have been in full
action. After a communication has been once
established between the two parts of the system, indeed,
the destruction of the brain or spinal cord may
stop secretion, not because these organs are indispensable
to secretion; but because the destruction
of one part of the system involves the death of the
other, just as the organic life itself perishes soon
after the destruction of the animal.</p>

<p><a id="para_775"></a>775. The existence of the organic nerve is probably
simultaneous with that of the secreting
artery: from the first to the last moment of life
the nerve regulates the artery; the influence of the
one is indispensable to the operation of the other;
and, by their conjoint action, the sentient nerve
itself, as well as every other organ, is constructed.</p>

<p><a id="para_776"></a>776. There is reason to believe that the physical
agent by which the organic nerve influences secretion
is electricity. The nerve appears to be the
medium by which electrical fluid is conveyed to
the secreting organs, and the nerve probably influences
secretion by influencing chemical combination,
through the intervention of this most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
powerful chemical agent. This is rendered probable
by the observation of various phenomena,
and by the result of direct experiment.</p>

<p><a id="para_777"></a>777. 1. It is proved that galvanic phenomena
may be excited by the contact of the nerve and
muscle in an animal recently dead. A galvanic pile
may be constructed of alternate layers of nervous
and muscular substance, or of nervous substance
and other animal tissues. A secreting organ liberally
supplied with organic nerve is probably then
in its physical structure nothing but a galvanic apparatus.
It is certain that some animals, as the
raia torpedo, possess a special electrical apparatus
composed essentially of nervous matter; that the
nerves which compose this apparatus correspond
strictly with the organic nerves of the human
body; that they are distributed principally to the
organs of digestion and secretion, and that they
exert a powerful influence over these processes;
for, when the animal is frequently excited to
give shocks, digestion appears to be completely
arrested; so that, after the animal’s death, food
swallowed some time previously is found wholly
unchanged.</p>

<p><a id="para_778"></a>778. 2. It is universally admitted that the nerves
in all animals possess an extreme sensibility to the
stimulus of electricity, and more especially to
that form of it which is termed galvanism.</p>

<p><a id="para_779"></a>779. 3. Direct experiment proves that the stimulus
of galvanism may be made to produce in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
living-body precisely the same effect as the nervous
influence. It has been stated, that the division
of the par vagum, in the neck of a living animal,
suspends the digestion of the food probably by
stopping indirectly the secretion of the gastric
juice. If after the division of the nerves, their
lower ends, that is, that portion of the nerves
which is still in communication with the stomach,
but no longer in communication with the brain, be
made to conduct galvanic fluid to the stomach,
secretion goes on as fast as when the nerves are
entire and conduct nervous influence. Dr. Wilson
Philip having divided the par vagum in the neck
of a living animal, coated a portion of the lower
end of the nerves with tin foil, placed a silver
plate over the stomach of the animal, and connected
respectively the tin and silver with the
opposite extremities of a galvanic apparatus.
The result was that the animal remained entirely
free from the distressing symptoms which had
always before attended the division of the nerves,
and that the process of digestion, which had been
invariably suspended by this operation, now went
on just as in the natural state of the stomach. On
examining the stomach after death, the food was
found perfectly digested, and afforded a striking
contrast to the state of the food contained in the
stomach of a similar animal, in whom the nerves
had been divided, but which had not been subjected
to the galvanic influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p><a id="para_780"></a>780. 4. On applying a low galvanic power to a
saline solution contained in an organic membrane,
Dr. Wollaston found that the galvanic fluid decomposed
the saline solution, and that the component
parts of the solution transuded through the membrane;
each constituent being separately attracted
to the corresponding wire of the interrupted
circuit. This experiment, says this acute and
philosophical physiologist, illustrates in a very
striking manner the agency of galvanism on the
animal fluids. Thus the quality of the secreted
fluid may probably enable us to judge of the
electrical state of the organ which produces it; as
for example, the general redundance of acid in
urine, though secreted from blood that is known
to be alkaline, appears to indicate in the kidney a
state of positive electricity; and since the proportion
of alkali in bile seems to be greater than is
contained in the blood of the same animal, it is
not improbable that the secretory vessels in the
liver may be comparatively negative.</p>

<p><a id="para_781"></a>781. We may imagine, says Dr. Young, that at
the division of a minute artery a nervous filament
pierces it on one side, and affords a pole positively
electrical, and another opposite filament a negative
pole. Then the particles of oxygen and nitrogen
contained in the blood, being most attracted by
the positive point, tend towards the branch which
is nearest to it; while those of the hydrogen and
carbon take the opposite channel; and that both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
these portions may be again subdivided, if it be
required; and the fluid thus analysed may be
recombined into new forms by the reunion of a
certain number of each of the kinds of minute
ramifications. In some cases the apparatus may
be somewhat more simple than this; in others,
perhaps, much more complicated; but we cannot
expect to trace the processes of Nature through
every particular step; we can only inquire into
the general direction of the path she follows.</p>

<p><a id="para_782"></a>782. Considerations such as these afford us a
glimpse into the mode in which Nature conducts
some of her most secret and subtile operations; or
rather into the immediate agency by which she
effects them; for, properly speaking, of the mode
in which she works, we do not obtain the slightest
insight, and even of her immediate agency our
view, at least in the present state of our knowledge,
is indistinct and vague. By the study of the
apparatus which she builds up, we can trace back
her operations a step or two; but in every case,
at a certain point, the apparatus itself becomes so
delicate as to elude our senses, and then of course
we are necessarily at a stand. So, the rough
materials with which she carries on her great
work of secretion, by careful analysis we can
separate into divers parts, and ascertain that
each part possesses peculiar properties. The
main channels by which she conveys these varied
constituents to the different parts of the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
we can trace; the delicate organs by which she
produces on these rude materials her wonderful
transformations we can see; but beyond the threshold
of these organs we cannot go. Why from
one common mass of fluid the same variety of
peculiar substances are constantly separated, and
each in its respective place: why the kidney
never secretes milk, nor the liver urine, nor the
breast bile: why membrane, and muscle, and
bone, and fat, and brain, are uniformly deposited
in the same precise situation: why these depositions
go on with uniformity, constancy and regularity;
and by what laws each process is controlled
and modified, we do not know. But though with
whatever diligence we investigate these operations,
the great problem remains, and probably ever
will remain unresolved, still it is both a pleasurable
and a profitable labour to follow Nature in
her path, to the extreme point to which it is possible
to trace her footstep; for the phenomena
themselves are often in the highest degree curious
and interesting; while their order and relation
can seldom be so considered as to be understood,
without the suggestion of practical applications of
great and permanent usefulness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<small>OF THE FUNCTION OF ABSORPTION.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Evidence of the process in the plant, in the animal—Apparatus
general and special—Experiments which prove
the absorbing power of blood-vessels and membrane—Decomposing
and analysing properties of membrane—Endosmose
and exosmose—Absorbing surfaces, pulmonary,
digestive, and cutaneous—Lacteal and lymphatic
vessels—Absorbent glands—Motion of the fluid in the

and lymphatics—Specific office performed by the several
parts of the apparatus of absorption—Condition of the
system on which the activity of the process depends—Uses
of the function.</p></blockquote>


<p><a id="para_783"></a>783. Absorption is the function by which external
substances are received into the body, and
the component particles of the body are taken up
from one part of the system, and deposited in
some other part. So universal and constant is the
operation, that there is not a fluid nor a solid, not
a surface nor a tissue, not an external nor an internal
organ, which is not, in its turn, the seat
and the subject of the process. By its action the
component particles of the living body are kept in
a state of perpetual mutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p><a id="para_784"></a>784. The plant in a humid atmosphere increases
in weight. The nutritive matter of the plant diffused
in the soil is taken up by its capillary rootlets, or
by the spongolæ which are attached to them, and
conveyed into the system. The fall of dew or rain
upon leaves promotes the growth of the plant.
Leaves placed on water are capable of preserving
not only their own vitality, but that of the branches
and twigs to which they are attached. These
phenomena show that the process of absorption is
carried on by the plant.</p>

<p><a id="para_785"></a>785. The evidence of the absorbing power possessed
by the animal is still more striking.</p>

<p><a id="para_786"></a>786. 1. If an animal be immersed in water the
amount of which is ascertained by measure, its
head being kept out of the water, so that none can
enter the mouth, the body increases in weight and
the water diminishes in quantity. If certain
animals, as snails, are plunged in water impregnated
with colouring matter, the fluids in the
interior of their body soon acquire the colour of
the water by which they are surrounded. Frogs,
previously kept for some time in dry air, when
placed in water, absorb a quantity equal in weight
to their whole body.</p>

<p><a id="para_787"></a>787. 2. In a humid atmosphere the animal increases
in weight still more than the plant.</p>

<p><a id="para_788"></a>788. 3. If a quantity of water be injected into
any of the great cavities of the body, as into that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the peritoneum, the whole of the fluid after a certain
time disappears; it is spontaneously removed.</p>

<p><a id="para_789"></a>789. 4. If in the progress of disease a fluid be
poured into any cavity of the body, as often happens
in dropsy, the whole of the fluid is removed,
sometimes spontaneously and quite suddenly; but
more often slowly, under the influence of medicinal
agents.</p>

<p><a id="para_790"></a>790. 5. Certain substances, whether applied to
an external or an internal surface, produce specific
effects on the system, just as when they are received
into the stomach or injected into the blood-vessels.
Mercury in mere contact with the skin,
but more rapidly when the application is aided by
friction, produces the same specific action upon
the salivary glands, and the same general action
upon the system as when the preparation of the
metal is received into the stomach. By the like
external and local application arsenic, opium,
tobacco, and other narcotics produce their distinct
and peculiar effects on the nervous system, and
their remote and general effects on the other systems.</p>

<p><a id="para_791"></a>791. 6. If an organ or tissue be deprived of nourishment,
it gradually diminishes in bulk, and at
length wholly disappears from the system. By long-continued
pressure, such as that occasioned by the
pulsation of a diseased artery, as in aneurism, or
by the growth of a fleshy tumor, portions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
firmest and strongest muscle, nay, even of the most
dense and compact bone, wholly disappear. At one
time the fluids diminish in quantity, the flesh
wastes, and the weight of the body is reduced one
half or more. Under other circumstances, while
the state of the general system remains stationary,
some particular part diminishes in size, or altogether
disappears.</p>

<p><a id="para_792"></a>792. 7. Healthy and strong men, engaged in
hard labour and exposed to intense heat, sometimes
lose, in the space of a single hour, upwards of five
pounds of their weight. Though daily engaged
for months together in this occupation at two different
periods of the day, for the space of an hour
each time, and though consequently these men
lose five pounds twice every day, yet when weighed
at intervals of three, six, or nine months, it is
found that the weight of the body remains stationary,
not varying, perhaps, more than a pound
or two. It follows that the bodies of these men
must absorb, twice every day, a quantity equal in
weight to that which they lose.</p>

<p><a id="para_793"></a>793. These phenomena depend on a power inherent
in the body, that of taking up and carrying
into the system certain substances in contact with
its surfaces, and of transporting from one part of
its system to another its own component particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_794"></a>794. The apparatus by which these operations
are carried on is general and special.</p>

<p><a id="para_795"></a>795. The general apparatus consists of blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>-vessels
and membrane. The special apparatus
consists of a peculiar system of vessels, namely, the
lacteals and lymphatics, together with the system
of glands termed conglobate.</p>

<p><a id="para_796"></a>796. It is proved by direct experiment that the
walls of blood-vessels exert a power by which substances
in contact with their external surface
penetrate their tissue, reach their internal surface,
and mix with the mass of the circulating fluids,
and that this property is possessed by all blood-vessels,
arteries and veins, great and small, dead
and living.</p>

<p><a id="para_797"></a>797. If a portion of a vein or artery taken from
the body be attached by either extremity to two
glass tubes in order to establish a current of warm
water in its interior, if the vein be then placed in
a fluid slightly acidulated, and the fluid which
flows through the vessel be collected in a flask,
this latter fluid becomes, in the space of a few
minutes, sensibly acid. In this experiment there
is no possibility of communication between the
current of warm water and the external acidulated
fluid, consequently the latter must penetrate the
parietes of the vessel, that is, absorption must
take place through its membranous walls.</p>

<p><a id="para_798"></a>798. A striking experiment demonstrates the absorbing
power of the living blood-vessels. If the trunk
of a vein or artery be exposed in a living animal,
and a poisonous substance in solution be dropped
on the external surface of either, the animal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
killed in a few minutes, just as when the poison
is injected into the blood-vessel itself. Analogous
experiments on the minute blood-vessels not only
show that they are endowed with the like absorbing
power, but that their number, tenuity and
extent, are conditions which greatly favour the
activity of the process.</p>

<p><a id="para_799"></a>799. Membrane is an organised substance
abounding with blood-vessels. Whether the absorbing
power possessed by this tissue be due
only to these vessels, or whether it be assisted
in the operation by other agents not yet fully
ascertained, it is certain that the absorbing power
it exerts is highly curious and wonderful.</p>

<p><a id="para_800"></a>800. An animal membrane placed in contact
with water becomes saturated with fluid: placed in
contact with a compound fluid, as with water or
spirit holding colouring matter in solution, the
membrane actually decomposes the compound and
resolves it into its elementary parts, just as accurately
as can be done by the chemist. If one
extremity of a piece of membrane be placed in a
vessel containing the tincture of iodine, for example,
and the other extremity be kept out of the
fluid, that portion of the membrane which is in
immediate contact with the tincture acquires a
perfectly dark colour, because the iodine completely
penetrates the substance of the membrane. This
dark-coloured portion is bounded by a definite
line, above which the membrane is penetrated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
a different part of the solution, by a pearly,
colourless fluid, the alcohol in which the iodine
was suspended. Above this again there are traces
of a still lighter coloured fluid, which is probably
water. In like manner, if strips of membrane are
placed in glasses containing port wine, the same
analytical process is effected by the membrane.
The colouring matter of the wine is imbibed by
the lower portion of the membrane; above this is
the alcohol, and above this the water.</p>

<p><a id="para_801"></a>801. These and many analogous experiments
demonstrate that the process of absorption is
accompanied with the further phenomena of decomposition
and analysis; and that membrane, at
the very moment it imbibes certain compound substances,
resolves them into their constituent elements.</p>

<p><a id="para_802"></a>802. It is further established by numerous experiments
that different compound substances are
decomposed and absorbed by membrane with different
degrees of facility. If strips of membrane
are placed in phials containing different kinds of
fluids, one fluid rises only a line or two; others
rise to the height of many inches. There is indubitable
evidence that analogous properties are
possessed by living membrane; that the mucous
membrane of the stomach at the moment it
imbibes, decomposes and analyses the alimentary
and medicinal substances in contact with its surface;
and consequently that in all animals mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>brane
becomes a most important agent in carrying
on the digestive process.</p>

<p><a id="para_803"></a>803. But perhaps the most remarkable property
possessed by membrane is that of establishing
in fluids in contact with its surfaces currents
through its parietes, which proceed in opposite
directions, according to the different natures of the
fluids, and more especially according to their different
densities. If small bladders composed of
membrane are filled with a fluid of greater density
than water, and securely fastened, and then
thrown into water, they acquire weight and become
swollen and tense. If the experiment be reversed;
if the bladders be filled with water and immersed
in a denser fluid, the denser fluid flows inwards to
the water, and the water passes from the interior
outwards. M. Dutrochet, who was led by accident
to the observation of these phenomena, and who
saw at once the possible importance of this agency
in some organic processes hitherto involved in
great obscurity, commenced an extended series of
experiments with a view to ascertain the exact
facts. He took the cæca of fowls, membranous
bags already made to his hand, into which he introduced
a quantity of fluid consisting of milk,
thin syrup, or gum-arabic dissolved in water.
Having securely tied the membranes, he placed
the bags thus filled in water, and found that two
opposite currents are established through the walls
of the cæca. The first and strongest current,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
that from without inwards, is formed by the flow
of the external water towards the thicker fluid
contained in the cæca; the second and weaker
current, that from within outwards, is formed by
the flow of the thicker interior fluid towards the
external water. The first or the in-going current
is termed <em>endosmose</em>, from ενδον, intus, and ωσμος,
impulsus, and the second or out-going current is
termed <em>exosmose</em>, from a similar combination of
Greek words signifying an impulse outwards.</p>

<p><a id="para_804"></a>804. The velocity and strength of these currents
are capable of exact admeasurement. The
amount of endosmose is measured by an apparatus
termed an endosmometer, which consists of a
small bottle, the bottom of which is taken out and
the aperture closed by a piece of bladder. Into
this bottle is poured some dense fluid; the neck of
the bottle is closed with a cork, through which a
glass tube, fixed upon a graduated scale, is passed.
The bottle is then placed in pure water. The
water by endosmose penetrates the bottle in
various quantities according to the density of the
fluid contained in its interior through the membrane
closing its bottom. The dense fluid in the
bottle, increased in quantity by the addition of the
water, rises in the tube fitted to its neck, and the
velocity of its ascent is the measure of the velocity
of the endosmose.</p>

<p><a id="para_805"></a>805. The strength of endosmose is measured
by a similar apparatus, in which a tube is twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
bent upon itself, and the ascending branch containing
a column of mercury which is raised by the fluid
in the interior of the endosmometer, as the volume
of this fluid is increased by the endosmose. By
means of these two instruments it is found that
the velocity and strength of endosmose follow the
same law, and that both are proportionate to the
excess of the density of the fluid contained in the
endosmometer above the density of water. By
numerous experiments it is ascertained that by
employing syrup of ordinary density (I. 33) an
endosmose is obtained, the strength of which is
capable of raising water more than 150 feet.</p>

<p><a id="para_806"></a>806. But though difference of density is necessary
to the production of endosmose, yet numerous
and decisive experiments show that the
different natures of fluids, irrespective of their
proportionate densities, materially influence the
activity and energy of the process. Thus, if
sugar-water and gum-water of the same density be
placed in the same endosmometer, the former produces
endosmose with a velocity as seventeen and
the latter only as eight. The endosmose produced
by a solution of the sulphate of soda is double that
produced by a solution of the hydro-chlorate of
soda of the same density. A solution of albumen
exerts an endosmose four times greater than a
solution of gelatin of the same density.</p>

<p><a id="para_807"></a>807. With organic fluids endosmose goes on
without ceasing until the chemical nature of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
fluids becomes altered by putrefaction; but with
alkalies, soluble salts, acids, and chemical agents
in general, the endosmose excited is capable only
of short continuance, because such agents enter
into chemical combination with the organic tissue
of the endosmometer, and thus destroy endosmose.</p>

<p><a id="para_808"></a>808. It is remarkable that the direction of the
endosmotic currents produced by vegetable membrane
is the exact reverse of that produced by
animal membrane under precisely the same circumstances.
Thus oxalic acid, when separated
from water by an animal membrane, invariably
exhibits endosmose from the acid towards the
water; when separated by a vegetable membrane,
from the water towards the acid: and the same is
the case with the tartaric and citric acids, and with
the sulphuric, the hydro-sulphuric, and the sulphurous
acids. I filled, says Dutrochet, a pod of the
<i>colutea arborescens</i>, which being opened at one end
only, and forming a little bag, was readily attached
by means of a ligature to a glass tube, with a solution
of oxalic acid, and having plunged it into rainwater,
endosmose was manifested by the ascent of
the contained acid fluid in the tube, that is to say,
the current flowed from the water towards the
acid. The lower part of the leek (<i>allium porrum</i>)
is enveloped or sheathed by the tubular petioles of
the leaves. By slitting these cylindrical tubes
down one side, vegetable membranous webs of
sufficient breadth and strength to be tied upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
reservoir of an endosmometer are readily obtained.
An endosmometer, fitted with one of these vegetable
membranes, having been filled with a solution
of oxalic acid and then plunged into rainwater,
the included fluid rose gradually in the
tube of the endosmometer, so that the endosmose
was from the water towards the acid, the reverse
of that which takes place when the endosmometer
is furnished with an animal membrane. Vegetable
membrane, then, at least with fluids containing
a preponderance of acid, produces a current,
the direction of which is the exact reverse of that
produced by animal membrane.</p>

<p><a id="para_809"></a>809. The bodies of organised beings are composed
in great part of various fluids of different
density, separated from each other by thin septa,
precisely the conditions which are necessary to the
production of endosmose. But such conditions
never concur in inorganic bodies, whence inorganic
bodies never exhibit endosmotic phenomena.
Vegetable tissue of every kind consists of vast
multitudes of aggregated cells intermingled with
tubes. The parietes of these hollow organs are
exceedingly delicate and thin; the organs themselves
are at all times filled with fluids, the
densities of which are infinitely various; consequently,
by endosmose and exosmose, mutual interchanges
of their contents incessantly go on;
those contents brought into contact by currents
moving now in one direction and now in another,
now rapidly and now slowly intermingle, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
consequence of their admixture changes in their
chemical composition take place. It is by these
powers that water holding in solution nutrient
matter diffused through the soil penetrates the
spongeolæ of the capillary rootlets, always filled
with a denser fluid than the water contained in the
soil,—that the energetic motion by which the sap
ascends is generated,—that the ascending sap is
attracted into fruits, always of greater density than
the crude sap,—that buds are capable of emptying
the tissue that surrounds them when they begin to
grow, and that almost all the phenomena connected
with the motions of fluids in plants, and
the chemical changes which those fluids undergo
in consequence of this admixture, is effected.
And there cannot be a question that analogous
phenomena take place in the various cells, cavities,
and minute capillary vessels of the animal body.</p>

<p><a id="para_810"></a>810. It is then established on indubitable
evidence that all animal tissues, without exception,
possess an inherent property by which they
are capable of transmitting through their substance
certain fluids, and even solids, convertible into
fluids; and that the great agent by which this
transmission is effected is membranous tissue,
whether in the form of blood-vessels or of
proper membrane. By virtue of this property
fluids and solids are absorbed, by the animal
body, with whatever surface or organ they are
in contact, whether with an external or an
internal surface, or with the eye, the mouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
the tongue, the stomach, the lungs, the liver, or
the heart.</p>

<p><a id="para_811"></a>811. But membrane is so disposed and modified,
in different parts of the body, as to admit
of the introduction of fluids and solids from the
exterior to the interior of the system with widely
different degrees of facility. There may be said
to be in the human body three great absorbing
surfaces, the pulmonary, the digestive, and the
cutaneous, each highly important, but each endowed
with exceedingly different degrees of absorbing
power.</p>

<p><a id="para_812"></a>812. The pulmonary surface, for reasons which
will be readily understood from what has been
already stated relative to the structure of the air
vesicles of the lungs, is by far the most active
absorbing surface of the body. The mode in
which the air vesicles are formed and disposed
has been shown to be such as to give to the lungs
an almost incredible extent of membranous surface,
while the membrane of which the cells are
composed is exceedingly fine and delicate. Moreover,
there is the freest possible communication
between all the branches of the pulmonary vascular
system, whether arteries or veins; the
distance between the lungs and the heart is short;
the course of the blood from the pulmonary capillaries
to the central engine that works the circulation
is rapid, and the lungs are at the same
time close to the central masses of the nervous
system, with which indeed they are placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
direct communication by nerves of great magnitude
and of most extensive distribution. These
circumstances account for the wonderful rapidity
with which substances are absorbed, when placed
in contact with the pulmonary surface, and for
the instantaneousness and intensity of the impression
produced upon the system, when the
substance thus introduced is of a deleterious
nature.</p>

<p><a id="para_813"></a>813. They also afford an explanation of a
phenomenon not to have been credited without
experience of the fact, that innoxious substances,
introduced into the air cells of the lungs in moderate
quantities produce no more inconvenience
there than when taken into the stomach. A
single drop of pure water, when in contact near the
glottis with the same membrane that forms the
air vesicles of the lungs, excites the most violent
and spasmodic cough, and the smallest particle of
a solid substance permanently remaining there
occasions so much irritation that inevitable suffocation
and death result. Yet so different is the
sensibility of this membrane in different parts of
its course, that while at the upper portion of the
trachea it will not bear a drop of water without
exciting violent disturbance, in the air vesicles it
tolerates with only slight inconvenience a considerable
quantity even of solid matter. An accident
of a nature sufficiently alarming, which
occurred to Dessault, affords a striking illustration
of this curious fact. This celebrated surgeon had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
to treat a case in which the trachea and esophagus
were cut through. It was necessary to introduce
a tube through the divided esophagus into the
stomach, and to sustain the patient by food introduced
in this manner. On one occasion the tube,
instead of being passed through the esophagus to
the stomach, was introduced into the trachea
down to the division of the bronchi. Several
injections of soup were actually thrown into the
lungs before the mistake was discovered; yet no
fatal, and even no dangerous consequences ensued.
Since that period, in various experiments on animals,
several substances of an innoxious nature
have been thrown into the lungs without producing
any inconvenience beyond slight disturbance
of the respiration and cough. The reason
is, that after a short time the substances are absorbed
by the membrane composing the air vesicles,
and are thus removed from the lungs and
borne into the general circulating mass. At every
point of the pulmonary tissue there is a vascular
tube ready to receive any substance imbibed by
it, and to carry it at once into the general current
of the circulation.</p>

<p><a id="para_814"></a>814. Hence the instantaneousness and the
dreadful energy with which poisons and other
noxious substances act upon the system when
brought into contact with the pulmonary tissue. A
solution of nux vomica injected into the trachea
produces death in a few seconds. A single inspi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>ration
of the concentrated prussic acid kills with the
rapidity of a stroke of lightning. This acid in its
concentrated form is so potent a poison, that it
requires the most extreme care in the use of it, and
more than one physiologist has been poisoned by it
through the want of proper precaution while employing
it for the purpose of experiment. If the
nose of an animal be slowly passed over a bottle
containing this poison, and the animal happen to
inspire during the moment of the passage, it
drops down dead instantaneously, just as when
the poison is applied in the form of liquid to the
tongue or the stomach. The vapour of chlorine
possesses the property of arresting the poisonous
effects of prussic acid, unless the latter be introduced
into the system in a dose sufficiently
strong to kill instantly; and, hence, when an
animal is all but dead from the effects of prussic
acid, it is sometimes suddenly restored to life by
holding its mouth over the vapour of chlorine.</p>

<p><a id="para_815"></a>815. Examples of the transmission of gaseous
bodies through the pulmonary membrane have
been already fully described in the account of the
passage of atmospheric air to the lungs, and of
carbonic acid gas from the lungs, in natural respiration.
But foreign substances may be mixed
with or suspended in the atmospheric air, which
it is the proper office of the pulmonary membrane
to transmit to the lungs, and may be immediately
carried with it into the circulating mass. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
merely passing through a recently-painted chamber
gives to the urine the odour of turpentine. The
vapour of turpentine diffused through the chamber
is transmitted to the lungs with the inspired air,
and passing into the circulation through the pulmonary
membrane, exhibits its effects in the
system more rapidly than if it had been taken into
the stomach, and thence absorbed.</p>

<p><a id="para_816"></a>816. Vegetable and animal matter in a state of
decomposition generates a poison, which when diffused
in the atmosphere, and transmitted to the
lungs in the inspired air, produces various diseases
of the most destructive kind. The exhalations
arising from marshes, bogs, and other uncultivated
and undrained places, constitute a poison of a
vegetable nature, which produces principally
intermittent fever or ague. Exhalations accumulating
in close, ill-ventilated, and crowded apartments
in the confined situations of densely-populated
cities, where no attention is paid to the
removal of putrefying and excrementitious matters,
constitute a poison chiefly of an animal nature,
which produces continued fever of the typhoid
character. It is proved by fatal experience that
there are situations in which these putrefying
matters, aided by heat and other peculiarities of
climate, generate a poison so intense and deadly
that a single inspiration of the air in which they
are diffused is capable of producing instantaneous
death; and that there are other situations in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
which a less highly concentrated poison accumulates,
the inspiration of which for a few
minutes produces a fever capable of destroying
life in from two to twelve hours. In dirty and
neglected ships, in which especially the bilge-water
is allowed to remain uncleansed; in damp,
crowded, and filthy gaols; in the crowded wards
of ill-ventilated hospitals filled with persons
labouring under malignant surgical diseases, or
some forms of typhus fever, an atmosphere is
generated which cannot be breathed long, even by
the most healthy and robust, without producing
highly dangerous fever.</p>

<p><a id="para_817"></a>817. The true nature of these poisonous exhalations
is demonstrated by direct experiment. If a
quantity of the air in which they are diffused be
collected, the vapour may be condensed by cold
and other agents, and a residuum of vegetable
or animal matter obtained, which is found to be
highly putrescent, constituting a deadly poison.
A minute quantity of this concentrated poison
applied to an animal previously in sound health,
destroys life with the most intense symptoms of
malignant fever. If, for example, ten or twelve
drops of a fluid containing this highly putrid
matter be injected into the jugular vein of a dog,
the animal is seized with acute fever; the action
of the heart is inordinately excited, the respiration
is accelerated, the heat increased, the prostration
of strength extreme, the muscular power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
so exhausted, that the animal lies on the ground
wholly unable to stir or to make the slightest
effort; and, after a short time, it is actually seized
with the black vomit, identical, in the nature of
the matter evacuated with that which is thrown
up by an individual labouring under yellow fever.
It is possible, by varying the intensity and the
dose of the poison thus obtained, to produce fever
of almost any type, endowed with almost any
degree of mortal power. These facts, of which
practical applications of the highest utility are
hereafter to be made, may suffice to show the importance
of the pulmonary membrane as an absorbing
surface. By the extent and energy of its
absorbing power, it is one of the great portals of
life and health, or of disease and death.</p>

<p><a id="para_818"></a>818. The digestive surface is of much less extent
than the pulmonary; it is less vascular; it is
further removed from the centre of the circulating
system, and it is covered with a thick mucus,
which is closely adherent to it; hence its absorbing
power is neither so great as that of the pulmonary
membrane, nor do noxious substances in
contact with it affect the system so rapidly. An
appreciable interval commonly elapses between
the introduction of a poison into the stomach and
its action upon the system. An emetic is commonly
a quarter of an hour before it begins to
operate: arsenic itself is generally half an hour,
and sometimes three quarters of an hour, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>fore
it produces any decided effect on the system:
but at length a noxious substance, applied to
any part of the digestive membrane is introduced
into the circulating mass and produces its appropriate
effects on the system, just as when it is in
contact with the pulmonary tissue.</p>

<p><a id="para_819"></a>819. Over the external surface of the body or
the skin, there is spread a thin layer of solid,
inorganic, insensible matter, like a varnish of
Indian rubber. The obvious effect of such a
barrier placed between the external surface of
the body and external objects, is to moderate
the entrance of substances from without,
and the transmission of substances from within,
that is, to regulate both the absorbing and the
exhaling power of the skin. Hence the comparative
slowness with which substances enter the
system by the cutaneous surface; the impunity
with which the most deadly poisons may remain
for a time in contact with the skin, with which
prussic acid, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, may be
touched and even handled. The internal surface
of the body is protected from the action of acrid
substances introduced into the alimentary canal
by a layer of mucus through which an irritant
must penetrate before it can pain the sentient
nerve or irritate the capillary vessel; but were
not a still denser shield thrown over the external
surface, pain, disease, and death must inevitably
result from the mere contact of innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
bodies, which now are not only perfectly innoxious,
but capable of ministering in a high degree to
human comfort and improvement.</p>

<p><a id="para_820"></a>820. Immediately beneath the cuticle is a surface
as vascular as it is sensitive, from which
absorption takes place with extreme rapidity.
Poison in very minute quantity introduced beneath
the cuticle kills in a few minutes. Arsenic applied
to surfaces from which the cuticle has been
removed by ulceration produces its poisonous
effects upon the system just as surely as when
introduced into the stomach. The poisonous
matter of small-pox and of cow-pox placed in
almost inappreciable quantity by the lancet
beneath the cuticle produces in a given time its
specific action upon the system. When, in certain
states of disease, with the view of bringing
the system rapidly under the influence of a medicinal
agent, the cuticle is removed by a blister,
and the exposed surface is moistened with a
solution of the substance whose action is required,
the constitutional effects are developed
with such intensity, that if extreme care be not
taken in the employment of any deleterious substance
in this mode the result is fatal in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><a id="para_821"></a>821. The phenomena which have been stated
may suffice to illustrate the absorbing power of
the general tissues and surfaces of the body; but
superadded to this, there is carried on in particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
parts of the system a specific absorption for which
a special apparatus is provided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_CXCII"></a>Fig. CXCII.</div>

<blockquote>

<p><small>An enlarged view of an absorbent vessel.—1. External

valves.—2. The same vessel laid open, showing the

<p><a id="para_822"></a>822. The special apparatus of absorption, commonly
termed the proper absorbent system, consists
of the lacteal and lymphatic vessels and of
the conglobate glands. The lacteals arise only
from the intestines; the lymphatics, it is presumed,
from every organ, tissue, and surface of
the body. Both sets of vessels possess a structure
strikingly analogous to that of veins, the common
agents of absorption. The coats of the lacteals
and lymphatics are somewhat thinner and a good
deal more transparent than those of veins; yet
thin and delicate as they are, they possess considerable
strength, for they are capable of bearing,
without rupture, injections which distend them far
beyond their natural magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p><a id="para_823"></a>823. When fully distended, these vessels present
a jointed appearance somewhat resembling a
string of beads (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a></span>. 1). Each joint indicates
the situation of a pair of valves (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a></span>.
2). These valves are of a semilunar form, and
are composed of a fold of the inner coat of the
vessel (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCII">CXCII</a></span>. 2). The convex side of the valve,
in the lacteals, is towards the intestines; in the
lymphatics towards the surfaces; in both towards
the origins of the vessels. The valves allow the
contents of the vessels to pass freely towards the
main trunk of the system, but prevent any
retrograde motion towards the origins of the
vessels.</p>

<p><a id="para_824"></a>824. By continued pressure the resistance of
the valves may be overcome, so that mercury may
be made to pass from the trunk into the branches.
When this is done in an absorbent trunk proceeding
from certain organs, such as the liver, it is seen
that the absorbents are distributed, arborescently,
in such vast numbers that the surface of the viscus
appears as if it were covered with a reticular sheet
of quicksilver.</p>

<p><a id="para_825"></a>825. The internal coat of the small intestines
has been shown to present a fleecy surface, crowded
with minute elevations called villi, which give this
surface an appearance closely resembling the pile
of velvet. Each villus consists of an artery, a
vein, a nerve, and a lacteal, united and sustained
by delicate cellular tissue. After a meal the lac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>teals
become so turgid with chyle that they completely
conceal the blood-vessels and nerves, so
that the surface of the intestine presents to the
eye only a white mass, or a surface thickly crowded
with white spots (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCIII">CXCIII</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a id="para_826"></a>826. When a portion of the intestine in this
condition of the lacteal vessels is examined under
the microscope, there is said to be visible on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
villus an oval vesicle, termed an ampullula (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCIV">CXCIV</a></span>.). This vesicle is described as having an
aperture at its apex, which it is conceived constitutes
the open mouth of the lacteal, and through
which the chyle is supposed to be taken up.</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p><a id="para_827"></a>827. Mr. Cruikshank, who particularly devoted
himself to the study of this part of the absorbent
system, states that he had an opportunity of examining
these vessels in a person who died suddenly
some hours after having taken a hearty
meal, and who had been previously in sound health.
“In some hundred villi,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> “I saw the
trunk of the lacteal beginning by radiated branches
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCV">CXCV</a></span>.). The orifices of these radii were very
distinct on the surface of the villus as well as the
radii themselves (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCV">CXCV</a></span>.). There was but one
trunk in each villus. The orifices on the villi of
the jejunum, as Dr. Hunter said (when I asked
him as he viewed them in the microscope how
many he thought there might be) were about
fifteen or twenty in each villus, and in some I saw
them still more numerous” (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCV">CXCV</a></span>.).</p>

<p><a id="para_828"></a>828. The course of the lacteals, from their
origin in the villi to their termination in the
thoracic duct, has been traced (<a href="#para_687">687</a>). It is
conjectured that the lymphatics take their origin
from every point of the body, but it is admitted
that they have not been actually seen even in
every organ; still they have been found in so
many that it is inferred that they really exist in all,
and that in those in which they have not been
hitherto detected they have eluded observation on
account of their extreme delicacy and transparency
and our imperfect means of examining them.</p>

<p><a id="para_829"></a>829. Though, like veins, lymphatics anastomose
freely with each other, yet they do not proceed
from smaller to larger branches and from larger
branches to trunks, but continue of nearly the
same magnitude from their origin to their termination.
They are disposed in two sets, one of
which always keeps near the external surface of
the body, and the other is deeply seated, accompanying
more especially the great trunks of the
blood-vessels.</p>

<p><a id="para_830"></a>830. In the human body every vessel that can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
be distinctly recognised either as a lacteal or a
lymphatic, passes, in some part of its course,
through a conglobate or lymphatic gland (figs.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVII">CXCVII</a></span>., <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVIII">CXCVIII</a></span>.).
These glands, small, flattened,
circular or oval bodies, resembling beans
in shape, are enclosed in a distinct membranous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
envelope. Their intimate structure has been already
fully described (chap. xi.). They are of
various sizes, ranging from three to ten lines in
diameter: they are placed in determinate parts
of the body, and are grouped together in various
ways, being sometimes single, but more often collected
in masses of considerable magnitude. Numerous
absorbent vessels, termed vasa inferentia,
enter the gland on the side remote from the heart
(figs. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVII">CXCVII</a></span>. 1 and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVIII">CXCVIII</a></span>. 1); a smaller number,
called vasa efferentia, leave it on the side proximate
to the heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVII">CXCVII</a></span>. 3). If mercury be
injected into the vasa inferentia (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVI">CXCVI</a></span>.), it
is seen to pass into a series of cells of the corresponding
gland (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVI">CXCVI</a></span>. 3), and then to
escape by the vasa efferentia; but if the gland be
more minutely injected, as by wax, all appearance
of cells vanishes; the whole substance of the
gland seems then to consist of convoluted absorbents
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVIII">CXCVIII</a></span>. 2), irregularly dilated, and
communicating with each other so intimately that
every branch that leaves the gland appears to have
been put in communication with every branch
that entered it (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CXCVIII">CXCVIII</a></span>. 1, 2, 3).</p>

<p><a id="para_831"></a>831. The motion of the fluid within the absorbent
vessels, though not rapid, is energetic. If a
ligature be placed around the thoracic duct in a
living animal, the tube will swell and ultimately
burst, from the rupture of its coat, in consequence
of the force of the distension that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
takes place below the ligature. If the thoracic
duct in the neck of a dog be opened some hours
after the animal has taken a full meal, the chyle
flows from the vessel in a full stream, and in
the space of five minutes half an ounce of the
fluid may be obtained. Yet this system of vessels
is beyond the influence of the circulating blood:
it has no heart to propel it; no current behind
always in rapid motion to urge it onwards; it is
therefore inferred that it is moved by a vital contractile
power inherent in the vessels, analogous
to, if not identical with, muscular contractility.
The flow of blood through the arterial tubes is
universally believed to be effected, in part at least,
by such a contractile power, for this, among other
reasons, that if in a living animal the trunk of an
artery be laid bare, the mere exposure of it to the
atmospheric air causes it to contract to such a
degree that its size becomes obviously and strikingly
diminished (298.1). The same phenomenon
has been observed in the main trunk of the
absorbent system. Tiedemann and Gmelin state
that in the course of their experiments they saw
the thoracic duct contract from exposure to the
air.</p>


<p><a id="para_832"></a>832. The delicacy and transparency of the
lacteals and lymphatics long concealed them from
the view of the anatomist. The lacteals had
indeed been occasionally seen in ancient times,
but their office was altogether unknown. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
year 1563 Eustachius discovered the thoracic
duct, but did not perceive its use. About half a
century afterwards, in the year 1622, the lacteals
were again one day by chance seen by Asellius, in
Italy, while investigating the function of certain
nerves. Mistaking the lacteals for nerves, he at
first paid no attention to them; but soon observing
that they did not pursue the same course as the
nerves, and “astonished at the novelty of the
thing,” he hesitated for some time in silence.
Resolving in his mind the doubts and controversies
of anatomists, of which it chanced that he
had been reading the very day before, in order to
examine the matter further, “I took,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
“a sharp scalpel to cut one of these chords, but
scarcely had I struck it when I found a liquor
white as milk, or rather like cream, to leap out.
At this sight I could not contain myself for joy;
but turning to the by-standers, Alexander Tadinus
and the senator Septalius, I cried out Εὕρηκα0!
with Archimedes; and at the same time invited
them to look at so rare and pleasing a spectacle;
with the novelty of which they were much moved.
But I was not long permitted to enjoy it, for the
dog now expired, and, wonderful to tell, at the
same instant the whole of that astonishing series
and congeries of vessels, losing its brilliant whiteness,
that fluid being gone, in our very hands,
and almost before our eyes, so evanished and disappeared
that hardly a vestige was left to my
most diligent search.” The next day he procured
another dog, but could not discover the smallest
white vessel. “And now,” he continues, “I
began to be downcast in my mind, thinking to
myself that what had been observed in the first
dog must be ranked among those rare things
which, according to Galen, are sometimes seen in
anatomy.” But at length recollecting that the
dog had been opened “athirst and unfed,” he
opened a third “after feeding him to satiety; and
now everything was more manifest and brilliant
than in the first case.” The zeal with which he
followed out the clue he had obtained is indicated
by the number of dogs, cats, iambs, hogs,
and cows which he dissected, and by the statement
that he even bought a horse and opened
it alive; but, he adds, “a living man, however,
which Erasistratus and Herophilus of old
did not fear to anatomize, I <em>confess</em>
 I did not
open.”</p>

<p><a id="para_833"></a>833. Nearly thirty years elapsed before the
lacteals, which were long thought to terminate in
the liver, were traced to the thoracic duct; and it
was not until the year 1651, about eighty years
after the discovery of Asellius, that the lymphatics
were discovered, and that the whole of this
portion of the absorbent system was brought
to light.</p>

<p><a id="para_834"></a>834. Taking together the whole of the appa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>ratus
of absorption, the specific office performed
by its several parts seems to be as follows:—</p>

<p><a id="para_835"></a>835. 1. It is established that the lacteals
absorb chyle, and that they refuse to take up
almost every other substance which can be presented
to them. Experimentalists are uniform in
stating that however various the substances introduced
into the stomach, it is exceedingly rare to
find in the lacteals anything but chyle. These
vessels appear to be endowed with a peculiar sensibility,
derived from the nervous system, by which
they are rendered capable of exerting an elective
power, readily absorbing some substances and
absolutely rejecting others.</p>

<p><a id="para_836"></a>836. 2. The lymphatics absorb a far greater
variety of substances than the lacteals, but not
all substances indiscriminately; chiefly organized
matter in a certain stage of purification; particles
passing through successive processes of refinement
(<a href="#para_707">707</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_837"></a>837. 3. The blood-vessels, and more especially
the capillary veins, appear to absorb indiscriminately
all substances, however heterogeneous
their nature, which are dissolved or dissolvable in
the fluids presented to them.</p>

<p><a id="para_838"></a>838. 4. The absorbent glands appear by
various modes, either by removing superfluous
and noxious matters, or by the addition of secreted
substances possessing assimilative properties, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
approximate the fluid which flows through them
more and more closely to the nature of the blood.
Fatal effects result from the artificial infusion of
minute portions even of mild substances into the
blood. Hence the extended and winding course
which Nature causes the new matter formed from
the food to undergo, even after its elaboration in
the digestive apparatus, in order that, before it is
allowed to mingle with the blood, its perfect purification
and assimilation may be secured.</p>

<p><a id="para_839"></a>839. The activity or inactivity of the process
of absorption is mainly dependant on the emptiness
or the plethora of the system. There is a
point of saturation beyond which the absorbent
vessels, though in immediate and continued contact
with absorbable matters, will take up no more.
The nearer the system to this point the less active
the process; the further the system from this
point the more active the process. Thus, when
an animal whose vessels are full to saturation is
immersed in water, or exposed to humid air, its
body does not increase in weight, and there is no
sensible diminution of the water; but the longer
an animal is kept without fluid, and the more it is
exposed to the action of a dry air, the further its
system is removed from the point of saturation,
and exactly in that proportion, when it is brought
in contact with water, is the diminution of the
quantity of the fluid and the increase in the
weight of the body. This law explains many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
circumstances of the animal economy,—why it is
impossible to dilute the blood or any other animal
fluid beyond a certain point, by any quantity of
liquid which may be in contact with the external
surface, or which may be taken into the stomach;
why it is impossible to introduce nutrient matter
into the system, beyond a certain point, by any
quantity of food, which the digestive organs may
convert into chyle; why, consequently, the bulk
and weight of the body are incapable of indefinite
increase; why that bulk and weight are so rapidly
regained after long abstinence; and why the appetite
is so keen, and the ordinary fulness and
plumpness of the body are so soon restored, after
recovery from fever and other acute diseases, when
the digestive organs have been uninjured.</p>

<p><a id="para_840"></a>840. Different portions of the absorbent apparatus
accomplish specific uses. With the absorbent
action of the capillary blood-vessels and of membranous
surfaces every organic function, but more
especially the processes of digestion and respiration,
are intimately connected.</p>

<p><a id="para_841"></a>841. The specific absorption carried on by the
lacteals has for its object the introduction of new
materials into the system, for the reparation of the
losses which it is constantly sustaining by the
unceasing actions of life.</p>

<p><a id="para_842"></a>842. The specific absorption carried on by the
lymphatics has a two-fold object. First, the introduction
of particles, which have already formed
an integrant part of the system, a second time into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the blood, in order to subject them anew to the
process of respiration, thereby affording them a
second purification, and giving them new and
higher properties; and, secondly, the regulation
of the growth of the body, and the communication
and preservation of its proper form.</p>

<p><a id="para_843"></a>843. It is the office of the lacteals to replenish
the blood by constantly pouring into it new
matter, duly prepared for its conversion into the
nutritive fluid. It is the office of the lymphatics
to preside over the distribution of the blood as
it is deposited in the system in the act of
nutrition. The lymphatics are the architects
which mould and fashion the body. They not
only regulate the extension of the frame, but they
retain each individual part in its exact position,
and give to it its exact size and shape. Growth
is not mere accretion, not simple distension; it
consists of a specific addition to every individual
part, while all the parts retain the same exact
relation to each other and to the whole. When a
bone grows it does not increase in bulk by the
mere accumulation of bony matter; but every
osseous particle is so increased in length and
breadth that the relative size of every part, and
the general configuration of the whole organ,
remain precisely the same. When a muscle
grows, while the entire organ enlarges in bulk by
the augmentation of every individual part, each
part retains exactly its former proportions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
its relative connexions. When the brain grows a
certain quantity of cerebral matter is added to
every individual part, but at the same time the
proportionate size and original form of each part,
and the primitive configuration of the entire
organ, are retained exactly the same. How is this
effected? By a totally new disposition of every
integrant particle of every part of every organ.
New matter is not deposited before the removal of
the old: the lymphatic, in the very act of removing
the old, fashions a mould for the reception of the
new, and then the capillary artery brings the new
particle and deposits it with unerring exactness in
the bed prepared for it. Thus, by removing the
old materials of the body in a determinate manner,
and thereby fashioning a mould for the reception
of the new, the lymphatics may be said, in the
strictest sense, to be the architects of the frame.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<small>OF THE FUNCTION OF EXCRETION.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

that excreted by the animal—Organs of excretion in the
human body—Organization of the skin—Excretory processes
performed by it—Excretory processes of the lungs—Analogous

<p><a id="para_844"></a>844. The various matters contained in organized
bodies, and even those which enter as constituent
elements into their composition, are constantly
removed from the system, and thrown off
into the external world. The matters thus rejected
are called excretions; and the various
processes by which their elimination is effected
constitute a common function termed excretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_845"></a>845. Excretion is the necessary consequence of
the deterioration which all organized matter undergoes
by the actions of life. The matters
removed by the process consist of the waste particles
of the body, or the particles expended in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
vital actions, as the aliment contains the particles
which replenish the waste, and compensate the
expenditure.</p>

<p><a id="para_846"></a>846. The excretions are separated from the
common organized mass by processes perfectly
analogous to those comprehended in the great
function of secretion. Excretion is only a particular
form of secretion: the difference between
the two functions is, that, in the former, the
matter eliminated being either noxious or useless,
is separated for the sole purpose of being rejected;
while, in the latter, the matter eliminated is
destined to perform some useful purpose in the
economy. Accordingly, the products of excretion
are termed excrementitious; and those of secretion,
recrementitious.</p>

<p><a id="para_847"></a>847. The chief matters excreted by the plant
are oxygen, carbonic acid, air; water, in some
few cases, under peculiar circumstances, ammonia
and chlorine; and in still rarer cases, during the
night, poisonous substances, as carburetted hydrogen,
together with acrid, and even narcotic
principles.</p>

<p><a id="para_848"></a>848. The forms under which these excretions
are eliminated are exceedingly various. Sometimes
the matter excreted is in the shape of gas, at
other times it is in that of vapour, and at others
in that of liquid. The chief gaseous exhalations
are oxygen and carbonic acid; the vaporous
exhalations consist principally of water, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
state of vapour; and the liquid exhalations are
either pure water, or water holding in combination
sugar, mucilage, and other proximate vegetable
principles. Even the peculiar products formed by
the vital actions of the plant, as the volatile
oils, the fixed oils, the balsams, the resins, and
perhaps, with the exception of gum, sugar, starch,
and lignine, all the substances formed out of the
proper juices of the plant, are true excretions;
for these substances are fixed immovably in the
cells, sacs, or tubes which secrete and contain
them: they are not consumed in the growth of
the plant; they do not appear to be applied to
any useful purpose in the economy; they are injurious,
and even poisonous to the very plant in
which they are formed when taken up by the
roots and combined with the sap: as long as they
remain in the plant they are isolated in the individual
parts in which they are first deposited,
until with the advancing age of the plant they
lose their aqueous particles, and are finally dried
up; they, therefore, possess all the essential characters
of excrementitious substances.</p>

<p><a id="para_849"></a>849. The organs by which these matters are
excreted are the leaves, the flowers, the fruits, the
roots, and certain bodies called glands.</p>

<p><a id="para_850"></a>850. The gaseous and vaporous exhalations
are effected chiefly by the leaves, which it has
been shown (320 and 465), under the influence
of the solar ray, are always pouring out a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
quantity of oxygen, and still larger quantities of
fluid in the state of vapour.</p>

<p><a id="para_851"></a>851. Similar matters are exhaled by the flowers
either in the form of vapour or of liquid; and
this exhalation commonly bears with it a peculiar
odour, which proceeds from an essential oil, sometimes
evaporated with the pollen, and at other
times secreted by glandular bodies which have
their seat in the petals.</p>

<p><a id="para_852"></a>852. Fruits, and especially green fruits, as
raspberries, pears, apples, plums, apricots, figs,
cherries, gooseberries, and grapes, pour out oxygen
during the day, and carbonic acid gas during the
night, and thus co-operate with leaves in carrying
on the function of excretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_853"></a>853. The more elaborate excretions contained
in special receptacles, and formed by diverse
organs from the proper juices of the plant, descend
chiefly by the bark, and are poured by the roots
into the soil. These excretions, if re-absorbed by
the roots, and re-introduced into the system of the
plant that has rejected them, poison that plant.
Consequently, two processes of deterioration are
always going on in the soil; first, the absorption
of the nutrient matter contained in it; and,
secondly, the accumulation of excrementitious
matter constantly poured into it by the growing
plant. By the addition of manure, the soil is replenished
with fresh nutritive materials; by a
rotation of crops, it is purified from noxious ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>cretions.
It is a remarkable and beautiful adjustment,
that excrementitious substances which
are destructive to plants of one natural family,
actually promote the growth of plants of a different
species. Thus, if wheat be sown upon a tract of
land proper for that grain, it may produce a good
crop the first, the second, and perhaps even the
third year, as long as the ground is what the
farmers call in good heart. But, after a time, it
will yield no more of that particular kind of corn.
Barley it may still bear, and, after this, oats, and
perhaps after these, pease, or some other species
belonging to a different family. The excrementitious
matter deposited in the soil by a preceding is
absorbed by a succeeding crop; the matter excreted
by the former serving as nutriment or
stimulus to the latter. But though in this mode
all noxious matter is removed from the soil, yet
the ground at last becomes quite barren, in consequence
of having parted with all its nutrient particles,
and then it will yield no more produce
until it is supplied with a new fund of matter.
This new matter is afforded by vegetable or animal
substances, in which, the principle of life
having become extinct, the peculiar bond that
held their particles together is dissolved. Leaves,
flowers, fruits, bark, roots; hair, skin, horns,
hoofs, fat, muscle, bone, the blood itself, whatever
has formed a part of the organized body, now
dead, and repassing through the process of decom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>position,
back to the simple physical elements, all
its forms of beauty gone, and exhaling only matters
highly deleterious to animal life, mixed with
the soil, are recombined into new products, spring
up into new plants, and thus re-appear under new
forms of beauty, and afford fresh nutriment to
myriads of animals. The very refuse of the
matters which have served as food and clothing to
the inhabitants of the crowded city, and which,
allowed to accumulate there, taint the air, and
render it pestilential, promptly removed, and
spread out on the surface of the surrounding
country, give it healthfulness, clothe it with verdure,
and endow it with inexhaustible fertility.</p>

<p><a id="para_854"></a>854. The quantity of matter excreted by the
plant is proportionate to the energy of its vital
actions. Hence it is always greatest in spring,
when the tender leaves are beginning to shoot;
gradually diminishes as autumn approaches; and,
at last, as the leaves turn yellow, and the vessels
which connect the leaves with the stalk dry up
and are closed, it almost wholly ceases.</p>

<p><a id="para_855"></a>855. It is copious in proportion to the number
of the leaves, and to the extent of the surface they
present. From experiments performed as long
ago as the year 1699, by Woodward, it appears
that, of the whole quantity of water absorbed by
the plant, the least proportion exhaled to that
retained is as 46 or 50 to 1; in many cases it is
as 100 or 200 to 1, and in some above 700 to 1.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
In one experiment, a plant which imbibed 2501
grains of water, increased in weight only three
grains and a half: hence the dampness and humidity
of the air in all places in which trees and
the larger vegetables abound; more especially
when the leaves are young, and most numerous
and active; and hence also the magnitude of the
rivers in all extensive countries which are covered
with forests.</p>

<p><a id="para_856"></a>856. Exhalation, scarcely appreciable in the
night, is most abundant during the day under the
influence of the solar light. If two plants of the
same size are covered with two glass bells, and
one be exposed to the sun’s light, while the other
is left in the shade, the inner surface of the former
bell becomes covered with drops of water, while
that of the second remains perfectly dry.</p>

<p><a id="para_857"></a>857. The absolute quantity of matter excreted
by the plant is widely different in different species.
According to Hales, in a sun-flower three
feet and a half high, the leaves of which presented
a surface of 5616 square inches, or 39 square feet,
the greatest quantity exhaled in twelve hours,
during the day, was one pound fourteen ounces
avoirdupois; the medium quantity one pound
four ounces. In a middle-sized cabbage, the
greatest quantity exhaled was one pound nine
ounces; the medium quantity one pound three
ounces. In a vine, the greatest quantity exhaled
was six ounces; the medium quantity five ounces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
In a young apple tree having 163 leaves, the surface
of which was equal to 1589 square inches, or
11 square feet, the greatest quantity exhaled was
eleven ounces; the medium quantity nine ounces.
Martino calculated the quantity exhaled by a
cabbage, in the twenty-four hours, at twenty-three
ounces; by a young mulberry-tree, eighteen
ounces; and, by a maize plant, seven drachms.</p>

<p><a id="para_858"></a>858. Supposing the weight of the human body
to be 160 pounds, and the weight of a sun-flower
3 pounds, the relative weights of the two bodies
will be as 160 to 3, or as 53 to 1. The surface of
such a human body is equal to 15 square feet, or
2160 square inches; the surface of the sun-flower
is 5616 square inches, or as 26 to 10. The quantity
perspired in the twenty-four hours by an ordinary-sized
man, according to the estimate of Keill,
is about thirty-one ounces. Allowing two ounces for
the exhalation during the beginning and the ending
of the night, the quantity exhaled by the plant,
in the same time, is twenty-two ounces; so that
the perspiration of a man to that of a sun-flower
is nearly as 141 to 100, though the weight of the
man to that of the sun-flower is as 53 to 1. Taking
bulk for bulk, the plant imbibes seventeen times
more fresh fluid than the man, partly, no doubt,
for the reason assigned by Hales—because,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> “the
fluid which is filtered through the roots of the
plant is not near so full freighted with nutrient
particles as the chyle which enters the lacteals of
the animal; the plant, therefore, requires a much
larger supply of fluid.”</p>

<p><a id="para_859"></a>859. As soon in the animal series as organs
are formed distinct from the homogeneous mass of
which the minute and simple beings placed at the
bottom of the scale appear to consist, these organs
are appropriated, at least in part, to the function
of excretion. In the human being, six organs
take a part, and are chiefly appropriated to this
function—namely, the skin, the lungs, the liver,
the adipose tissue, the kidneys, and the intestinal
canal. All these organs serve other purposes in
the economy; but still the removal, in some specific
form, of excrementitious matter from the
system, is a most important part of the office of
each.</p>

<p><a id="para_860"></a>860. The skin (34), to which are assigned numerous
and highly important offices, seems to be
specially constructed for performing the function of
excretion. It is composed of three layers, of which
the internal is called the cutis, or true skin; the
external the cuticle, or scarf skin; and the middle,
by which the other two are united, the rete
mucosum. The latter is indistinct, excepting in
the negro, in whom it is the seat of colour.</p>

<p><a id="para_861"></a>861. The cutis, or true skin, is a dense membrane,
composed of firm and strong fibres, interwoven
like a felt. Its internal surface is marked
by numerous depressions, which receive processes
of the adipose tissue beneath. Over its external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
surface is spread a delicate and complex net-work
of vessels, termed the vascular plexus, of such
extent and capacity that, in the natural state
of the circulation, a very large proportion of
the whole blood of the body is constantly
flowing in these blood-vessels of the cutis. A
prodigious number of nerves accompany the
cutaneous blood-vessels, some derived from the
organic, and others from the sentient portion of
the nervous system. The organic nerves endow
the arteries with the power of performing the
organic processes proper to the cutis, which are
principally of an excrementitious nature. The
sentient nerves communicate to every point of the
external surface of the cutis the exquisite degree
of sensibility possessed by the skin. Innumerable
absorbent vessels terminate at the same
points, with the capillary arteries and the sentient
nerves.</p>

<p><a id="para_862"></a>862. The extreme smoothness and softness
natural to the skin is communicated to it by a
number of follicles which are placed in the cutis,
and are termed sebaceous, from the oily substance
they secrete. It is the matter secreted by these
organs which communicates to the animal body
the odour peculiar to it, on which the scent
depends.</p>

<p><a id="para_863"></a>863. In many parts the cutis is perforated
obliquely by hairs, which spring from little bulbs
beneath it, to which the growth of the hairs is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
confined. The human hair, which is hollow,
consists of fine tubes filled with an oily matter.
This matter is either of a black, red, yellow, or
pale colour, as the hair is black, red, yellow, or
white.</p>

<p><a id="para_864"></a>864. The nails are products formed by the
cutis, and are essentially the same as the cuticle.</p>

<p><a id="para_865"></a>865. By long-continued boiling the cutis is
resolvable into gelatin, which by evaporation
becomes glue, and by combining with tannin and
the extractive of oak bark is converted into
leather.</p>

<p><a id="para_866"></a>866. The third portion of the skin, the cuticle,
is a thin, elastic membrane spread over the external
surface of the cutis, from which it is easily
detached, by the action of a blister in the living,
and by the process of putrefaction in the dead
body. It is without vessels and nerves, and consequently
it is insensible and inorganic. It is
formed as a secretion by the cutis, and is composed
almost entirely of solid albumen. When
any portion of it is removed, it is renewed with
great rapidity. Since it is subject to constant
waste from friction, and is much increased by
pressure, as is manifest in the palms of the hands
and the soles of the feet, its formation must be
continual; yet even in the fœtus it is thicker in
the parts where pressure is ultimately to be made
than in the other parts of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_867"></a>867. The cuticle is a sheath in which the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
is enclosed for the purpose of restraining the
organic actions which take place at its surface,
and for tempering the sentient impressions received
there. For restraining the organic actions it is
fitted by the cohesion of its parts, which is such
as to receive and transmit any fluid very slowly, as
is manifest from the dryness of its surface when
it is raised in a blister, and from the extreme rapidity
with which the cutis dries, until it becomes as
hard as parchment, when the cuticle is removed
from it in the dead body.</p>

<p><a id="para_868"></a>868. Diffused over every part and particle of
the cutis is the seat of common sensation, that
cognizance may be taken of the presence of
external objects. Restricted to particular points,
the tips of the fingers, is the seat of one of the
special senses, that of touch. Had the nerves
which communicate to this extended surface its
acute sensibility been placed in direct contact
with external bodies, intolerable pain would have
been the result; but by covering this surface with
an inorganic and insensible substance, yet so thin
that it is a pellicle rather than a membrane, the
organ of sense is shielded, while the delicacy of
the sensation is not impaired. But the control of
the organic process and the protection of the
sentient nerve are not the only offices performed
by the cuticle; it serves further to hide what it is
undesirable to have constantly in view. All that
is beautiful in the blood as an object of sense is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
rendered visible through the cuticle, in the bright
and rosy hue of health, at the same time that
every process, the sight of which would excite
anxiety or terror, is effectually concealed.</p>

<p><a id="para_869"></a>869. The skin, an organ of secretion, an
organ of absorption, an organ of excretion, and
an organ of sense, is thus the immediate seat
of three organic processes and of one animal
process.</p>

<p><a id="para_870"></a>870. The chief excretion performed by the
skin, in the human body, is commonly known
under the name of perspiration. The perspiration
is either sensible or insensible. Sensible perspiration
is the liquid commonly called the sweat.
Insensible perspiration consists of a vapour which,
under the ordinary circumstances in which the
body is placed, is invisible. The invisible vapour
is constantly exhaling; the visible liquid is only
occasionally formed. The quantity of matter
carried out of the system under the form of invisible
vapour is much greater than that lost by the
visible liquid.</p>

<p><a id="para_871"></a>871. That a quantity of matter is incessantly
passing off from the surface of the skin, under the
form of an invisible vapour, is proved by the following
facts:—</p>

<p>1. If the hand and arm are enclosed in a glass
jar, the inner surface of the glass soon becomes
covered with moisture.</p>

<p>2. If the tip of the finger be held at about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
twelfth of an inch from a mirror, or any other
highly polished surface, the surface rapidly becomes
dimmed by the vapour which condenses upon it
in small drops, and which disappear on the
removal of the finger.</p>

<p>3. If the body be weighed at different periods,
an accurate account being taken of the ingesta
and the egesta, it is found to undergo a loss of
weight sensibly greater than can be attributed to
any of the visible discharges: this loss must be
owing to the transmission of a quantity of matter
out of the body, under the form of invisible
vapour.</p>

<p><a id="para_872"></a>872. The matters excreted under the form of
perspiration are separated from the blood by a
true and proper secretion, like the other secretions
of the body. The process by which this is
effected is called transudation. The matter of
transudation deposited on the surface of the skin
by a vital function is removed from the body by
evaporation, a physical process which consists of
the conversion of a liquid into a vapour by the
addition of heat. Consequently the process of
perspiration is a cooling process, and it is chiefly
by the increase of the perspiration that the body
is enabled to bear the intense degrees of heat
which it has been shown (491, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>) to be
capable of sustaining. Sitting one day in repose
in the shade during the intense heat of an American
summer’s day, the skin freely perspiring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
every pore, Dr. Franklin happened to examine
the temperature of his body with a thermometer.
He found that the temperature of his body was
several degrees lower than that of the surrounding
air. The physiologists who exposed themselves
in heated chambers, for the sake of ascertaining
the greatest degree of heat which the human body
is capable of enduring, perspired profusely during
the experiment (<a href="#para_495">495</a>). The artisans who carry on
their daily occupations in elevated temperatures
perspire most profusely (884, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>). Under such
circumstances, caloric is communicated to the
human body just as freely as to inorganic matter
yet it does not injure the body, because it does
not accumulate in the system, but is immediately
expended in supplying the heat necessary to convert
the water, which is poured out upon the skin,
into vapour. In this manner that surface of the
body at which, under ordinary circumstances, a
large portion of its animal heat is generated, is the
very surface at which, under extraordinary circumstances,
cold is generated, and the heat of the system
positively reduced.</p>

<p><a id="para_873"></a>873. The physical process of evaporation
would go on to a certain extent, though the vital
function of transudation did not exist, and does
go on in the dead body when the vital function is
at an end. An organic tissue enclosing a liquid
may not be porous enough to give passage to a
single drop of liquid, and yet sufficiently porous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
admit air. In this case the air in contact with the
tissue dissolves the liquid in its interior, and
carries it off in the form of invisible vapour;
hence liquids contained in organic bodies in contact
with the air diminish in quantity by evaporation.
But if an animal be placed in air saturated
with moisture, and of the same temperature
as its own, the air can no longer deprive
that animal of a single particle of its moisture:
evaporation from the body, in such a condition
of the air, is suppressed. On the other hand,
when an animal is placed in air saturated
with moisture, and of the same temperature
as its own, so far is transudation from being
suppressed, that the sweat streams from every
part of the external surface of the body. By
modifying the condition of the air, in regard
to its hygrometrical state and its temperature, the
result of the physical process and of the vital
function may thus be separated from each other,
and the amount of each may be ascertained with
perfect exactness. Now, by numerous experiments
on the cold-blooded vertebrata, placed under
such conditions of the air, it is found that, in
these animals, perspiration by evaporation is to
that by transudation as 6 to 1. But since the
human body presents to the air an immense extent
of surface over which is constantly flowing a large
proportion of the whole quantity of blood contained
in the system, the loss by the physical process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
compared with that by the vital function must
be still greater in man than in the cold-blooded
animal.</p>

<p><a id="para_874"></a>874. Taking together the average quantity of
matter removed from the human body by both
processes, or the whole loss of weight sustained
from perspiration, on the comparison of the results
of many observations, it is estimated to
vary from twenty ounces in the twenty-four hours
of the colder, to forty ounces in the warmer
climates of Europe. Keill estimated it at thirty-one
ounces. In the climate of Paris it is stated
to be thirty ounces.</p>

<p><a id="para_875"></a>875. By the delicate tests of modern chemistry,
various substances are found to be contained
in the aqueous fluid which constitutes the
great proportion of the matter of perspiration,
namely, an acid, probably the lactic, a small proportion
of animal matter, some alkaline and earthy
salts, an oily or fatty substance, probably derived
from the sebaceous follicles. All these matters are
so analogous to the constituents of the serum of
the blood as to leave little ground for doubt that
they are merely separated from this part of the
blood as it is flowing through the complex net-work
of vessels spread over the surface of the
cutis (<a href="#para_861">861</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_876"></a>876. The skin, when in contact with the air,
also separates a portion of carbon from the
blood, and to the extent in which it does this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
it is auxiliary to the lungs; but the quantity of
carbonic acid excreted by the skin is small and
variable in amount. The primary office of the
skin as an organ of excretion is to relieve the
blood of its superabundant watery particles, that
is, to remove from the system its superfluous
hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="para_877"></a>877. A full account has been given (359, <i lang="la">et
seq.</i>) of the primary office of the lungs, which, it
has been shown, is to decarbonize the blood. The
details of the calculations have been stated (<a href="#para_457">457</a>),
from which it is estimated that 10 ounces and 116
grains of carbon are daily exhaled by the lungs under
the form of carbonic acid; and the reasons have
been assigned which favour the conclusion that the
carbonic acid expired is not formed immediately
in the lungs by the combination of the oxygen of
the atmospheric air with the carbon of the blood;
but in the system, where the oxygen taken into
the blood at the lungs unites with carbon, the
carbonic acid resulting from the combination
passing as soon as formed into the capillary veins.
The blood contained in these vessels, thus become
venous, returns to the lungs, where it gives off the
carbonic acid accumulated in it, and by that depuration
again assumes its arterial character.</p>

<p><a id="para_878"></a>878. Some interesting experiments performed
by Dr. Stevens appear to show that there exists a
powerful attraction between oxygen and carbonic
acid, and that the venous blood, as it is flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
through the lungs, is freed from its carbonic acid
by virtue of that attraction. Chemists were so
universally agreed that the carbon in carbonic acid
is united with its maximum dose of oxygen, that
the idea of an attraction between carbonic acid
and oxygen appeared highly improbable. The
evidence of the fact, however, is decisive. If a
receiver, filled with carbonic acid, and closed by a
piece of bladder, firmly tied over it, be exposed to
the atmospheric air, the carbonic acid, notwithstanding
its superior specific gravity, rapidly
escapes, and does so without the exchange of an
equivalent portion of atmospheric air; the bladder
is consequently forcibly depressed into the receiver.
If the converse of this experiment be tried, and
the receiver, containing atmospheric air, be tied
over with a piece of bladder or thin leather, and
then be immersed in carbonic acid, this gas will so
abundantly penetrate the membrane and enter the
receiver as to endanger its bursting.</p>

<p><a id="para_879"></a>879. Dr. Stevens had repeated opportunities
of verifying these facts, during a stay which he
made at Saratoga, in the United States, the springs
at which place liberate a large quantity of carbonic
acid. In the high rocks it often collects in
considerable quantity and purity, and experiments
on dogs and rabbits are often made for the entertainment
of strangers, as at the Grotto del Cano,
near Naples. This rock stands by itself in a low
valley, through which there run two currents of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
water, the one fresh and superficial, the other
beneath and charged with salts and carbonic acid.
A current of this water rises to some height in a
cavity of the high rock, which appears to have
been formed by a deposition of earthy salts from
the water. It has a conical figure, the base of
which is below the surface of the ground, and is
about nine feet in diameter. It rises about five
feet from the ground, where it is truncated, and
presents an aperture a foot in diameter. The
water rises in general only about two feet above
the ground, and in the three feet above the surface
of the water the liberated carbonic acid collects.
By luting a large funnel over the aperture, carbonic
acid may be collected at the mouth of the
funnel in indefinite quantities, of which Dr. Stevens
availed himself to multiply and vary his experiments,
the result of which appears to be the complete
establishment of the fact that there exists a
powerful attraction between carbonic acid and
oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="para_880"></a>880. The application of this fact to the explanation
of the phenomena of respiration is highly
interesting. By virtue of this mutual attraction,
two currents are established, which flow in opposite
directions, through the membranous matter of the
air-vesicles of the lungs and the pulmonary blood-vessels
spread out upon their surface; the oxygen
of the air flows to the blood attracted by its carbonic
acid, and the carbonic acid of the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
flows to the air attracted by its oxygen. According
to Dr. Stevens, the moment the blood parts with
its carbonic acid it loses its dark colour, and
becomes of a bright vermilion colour, for the following
reason: all acids impart a dark colour to
the blood. With respect to most acids, this colour
remains, although the added acid be afterwards
saturated. Carbonic acid forms an exception, for
on the removal of this aërial acid the blood resumes
its bright and arterial colour. Alkalies, like acids,
darken the colour of the blood, but salts produce a
bright and vermilion colour when added to the
colouring matter of the blood. When the blood
loses its carbonic acid, the salts contained in the
blood produce upon its colouring matter the vermilion
tint natural to the combination when the
influence of the salts is not counteracted by the
presence of a redundant acid. At the moment the
venous blood gives up its carbonic acid it receives
in exchange a portion of the inspired air, which is
chiefly at the expense of the oxygen. It retains
somewhat more oxygen than it yields back in the
shape of carbonic acid. The reddened and oxygenated
blood, having returned to the heart, is
diffused over the system, where it parts with its
oxygen and combines with carbon, forming by the
union carbonic acid; the necessary result of this
combination is the generation of animal heat in
the exact proportion to the quantity of the carbonic
acid which is produced. The venous blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
which receives the carbonic acid as it is formed in
the system, is darkened by its presence, which
counteracts the effects of the salts of the blood
upon its colouring matter.</p>

<p><a id="para_881"></a>881. An account has been given (<a href="#para_439">439</a>) of the
experiments, which prove that the lungs also constantly
exhale a quantity of azote.</p>

<p><a id="para_882"></a>882. It has been further shown (<a href="#para_469">469</a>) that,
together with the carbonic acid, which passes off in
the inspired air, there is always present a quantity
of aqueous vapour. This aqueous vapour is not
visible at the ordinary temperature of the air in
its ordinary hygrometric state, because the water is
then dissolved in the air, and is carried off in the
form of invisible vapour; but it becomes abundantly
manifest at a low temperature, or when the
air is loaded with moisture. By the removal of
this aqueous vapour, the lungs assist the skin in
the depuration of the blood. The water transpired
by the lungs, like that perspired through the skin,
is separated from the blood by a true and proper
secretion constituting the pulmonary transudation.
It is commonly estimated that the lungs exhale
about one-third as much as the skin, or fifteen
ounces daily. Dalton estimates it at twenty-four
ounces.</p>

<p><a id="para_883"></a>883. These estimates of the quantity of fluid
lost by cutaneous and pulmonary transpiration
relate to the quantities lost at the ordinary external
temperatures in which the human body is placed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
The quantity lost when the body is exposed to an
elevated temperature is prodigiously increased.
It did not occur to the physiologists, whose experiments
have been detailed (492, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), to ascertain
this by causing themselves to be accurately weighed
immediately before they entered their heated chamber
and immediately after they left it. Having
heard that the loss daily sustained by the workmen
employed in gas-works is very extraordinary, I
endeavoured to ascertain the amount of it with
exactness. This I have been enabled to accomplish
by the assistance of Mr. Monro, the manager
of the Phœnix Gas Works, and of Mr. Cooper.
The following are the experiments by which this
has been ascertained.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">EXPERIMENT I.</span>—November 18, 1836, at the
Phœnix Gas Works, Bankside, London.</p>

<p><a id="para_884"></a>884. Eight of the workmen regularly employed
at this establishment in drawing and charging the
retorts and in making up the fires, which labour
they perform twice every day, commonly for the
space of one hour, were accurately weighed in
their clothes immediately before they began and
after they had finished their work. On this occasion
they continued at their work exactly three-quarters
of an hour. In the interval between the
first and second weighing, the men were allowed
to partake of no solid or liquid, nor to part with
either. The day was bright and clear, with much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
wind. The men worked in the open air, the temperature
of which was 60° Farh. The barometer
29° 25´ to 29° 4´.</p>

<p><a id="para_888"></a>888. The two last men worked in a very hot place
for one hour and ten minutes; all the rest worked
about one hour. Michael Griffiths, as soon as he
had finished his work, was put into a bath at 98°,
where he remained half an hour. He was reweighed
on coming out of the bath, and had
lost 8 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_889"></a>889. From these observations it appears that,
towards the end of November, when the temperature
of the external air was 39°, and the day
was foggy and without wind, the greatest loss did
not amount to 3 lbs. (2 lbs. 15 oz.), the least
loss was 14 oz., and the average loss was 2 lbs.
3 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_890"></a>890. In the middle of the same month, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
the temperature of the air was 60°, and the day
was clear with much wind, the greatest loss was
4 lbs. 3 oz., the least loss was 2 lbs. 8 oz., and the
average loss was 3 lbs. 6 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_891"></a>891. In June, when the temperature of the
external air was 60°, and the day exceedingly
bright and clear, without much wind, the greatest
loss was 5 lbs. 2 oz., the next greatest loss was
4 lbs. 14 oz., the least loss was 2 lbs., and the
average loss was 2 lbs. 8 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_892"></a>892. The same individuals lose very different
quantities at different times. Thus, James Finnigan
in the first experiment lost 3 lbs. 6 oz., in the
second 2 lbs. 8oz. Michael Griffiths in the first
experiment lost 2 lbs. 8oz., in the second 2 lbs.
6 oz., and in the third 3 lbs.; while John Kenny
in the first experiment lost 2 lbs. 9 oz., and in the
third experiment, which was the second to which
he was subjected, he lost very nearly the same,
namely, 2 lbs. 10 oz. On the other hand, Bryan
Glynon in the first experiment lost 4 lbs. 3 oz.,
and in the third experiment, which was the second
to which he was subjected, he lost no more than
2 lbs. 12 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_893"></a>893. In one case, when a man who had lost
2 lbs. 15 oz., the greatest quantity lost by any of
the men examined during that day, was put into
a hot bath at 95°, and reweighed on coming out
of the bath, where he had remained exactly half
an hour, it was found that he had gained half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
pound. On the other hand, when a man who had
lost 3 lbs. was put into a hot bath at 98°, and kept
there for half an hour and reweighed, it was found
that he had lost exactly half a pound.</p>

<p><a id="para_894"></a>894. It was our intention to have pursued
these experiments, with the view of ascertaining
the influence of the hygrometrical state of the air
on transpiration, as well as the absorbing power
of the skin, under circumstances so favourable to
the activity of that power, but the investigation
has been unavoidably postponed.</p>

<p><a id="para_895"></a>895. The results of these observations are as
interesting in relation to absorption as to transpiration.
Thus, James Finnigan, on the 18th of
November, weighed,</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June he weighed 1 cwt. 27 lbs.,
having lost 1 lb. 4 oz.</p>

<p><a id="para_898"></a>898. Thus, in the course of their ordinary occupation,
these men are in the habit of losing from
2 lbs. to 5 lbs. and upwards twice a-day; yet,
when weighed at distant intervals, it is found that
some have actually gained in weight and others
have lost only a few pounds; it follows that the
activity of the daily absorption must be proportionate
to that of the daily transpiration.</p>

<p><a id="para_899"></a>899. According to the prevalent opinion, the liver
is the cause of a large proportion of the maladies
which afflict and destroy human life. It certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
exercises an important influence over health and
disease, the true reason of which is but little
understood by those who attribute most to its
agency.</p>

<p><a id="para_900"></a>900. The liver is an organ of digestion and an
organ of excretion.</p>

<p>It is an organ of digestion in a two-fold mode:</p>

<p>1. By the secretion of a peculiar fluid, through
the direct action of which chyme is converted into
chyle. The several phenomena attending this
operation have been fully described (668 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>2. By subjecting alimentary matters which have
been partly acted on by the stomach and intestines
to a second digestion.</p>

<p><a id="para_901"></a>901. It has been shown (<a href="#para_666">666</a>) that the
veins which return the blood from the digestive
organs, the stomach, the intestines, and the mesentery,
together with the veins of the spleen, the
omentum and the pancreas, instead of pursuing a
direct course to the right side of the heart in
order to transmit their contents by the shortest
route to the lungs, as is the case with all the other
veins of the body, unite together and form a large
trunk termed the vena portæ, which enters the
liver and ramifies through it in the manner of an
artery. It has been further shown (<a href="#para_666">666</a>) that
the bile is secreted from the venous blood contained
in this vessel by its capillary branches
spread out on the walls of the biliary ducts, the
only known instance in the human body in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
a secretion is formed from venous blood by venous
capillaries; that the trunk of this vein, unlike
that of any other, is encompassed with organic
nerves, which accompany its subdivisions, and are
spread out upon its capillary branches just as an
organic nerve is spent upon an artery, and that
thus, as this vessel performs the function of an
artery, it has the structure and distribution of an
artery.</p>

<p><a id="para_902"></a>902. The veins which unite to form the vena
portæ take up, by their capillary branches, certain
portions of the contents of their respective organs,
and bear those contents directly into the venous
current. The capillary veins of the stomach take
up certain parts of the contents of the stomach, it
would appear the fluid substances received with
the aliment more especially; the capillary veins of
the duodenum take up certain portions of the contents
of the duodenum, and so on of the capillary
veins of the spleen, intestines, and all
the organs whose veins combine to form the vena
portæ. Further, branches of the absorbent vessels
of these organs have been distinctly traced
opening directly into the veins in their immediate
neighbourhood. Certain products of digestion
must, then, be constantly poured, both by the
capillary veins and by the absorbent vessels of the
digestive organs, into the blood of the vena portæ.</p>

<p><a id="para_903"></a>903. Accordingly, on the examination of animals
soon after a meal, streaks of a substance like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
chyle are often observed in the blood of the vena
portæ. It is further established by numerous
experiments, that if alcohol, gamboge, indigo, and
other odoriferous and colouring matters, are mixed
with the food, their presence is manifest in the
blood of the digestive organs, and more especially
in the blood of the mesenteric veins and in that
of the vena portæ, while no trace of these substances
is ever found in the lacteals.</p>

<p><a id="para_904"></a>904. The lacteals, it has been shown (835. 1.),
are special organs appropriated to the performance
of a specific function, that of absorbing chyle. To
fit them for this office, they are endowed with an
elective power, by virtue of which they select, from
the alimentary mass, that portion of it only which
is converted into chyle; in a natural and healthy
state they would appear to be incapable of absorbing
any other substance excepting pure chyle.
But in the digestive organs there is always present
much nutritive matter not yet converted into proper
chyle, and with this matter there are mixed
foreign substances not strictly alimentary. These
unassimilated matters and foreign substances,
absorbed by the capillary veins or by the absorbent
vessels, or by both, are conveyed directly into the
vena portæ, by which vessel they are transmitted
to the liver, where they undergo a true and proper
digestion. After undergoing this digestion in the
liver, they are sent by a short course to the heart,
and thence to the lungs, where they are assimilated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
into, or at least commingled with, arterial blood,
and, with arterial blood, are transmitted to the
system. The substances subjected to this hepatic
digestion, which is as real as that effected in the
stomach and duodenum, do not appear to enter
the lacteals at all; they have therefore a shorter
course to traverse, and probably a proportionately
less elaborate process to undergo, before their transmission
to the lungs and their final entrance into
the arterial system.</p>

<p><a id="para_905"></a>905. What the particular substances are for
which this slighter digestive process suffices is not
known with certainty. There is, however, reason
to suppose that they consist chiefly of liquids,
while there is direct evidence that vinous and
spirituous liquids enter the system through this
shorter course; since these fluids are often
abundantly manifest in the blood of the vena
portæ, when not the slightest trace of them can be
detected in the lacteal vessels.</p>

<p><a id="para_906"></a>906. According to this view, the liver is a
second digestive apparatus, completing what the
first commences, or effecting what that is incapable
of accomplishing; and this view assigns the
reason why certain fluids taken into the stomach
sometimes appear in the secretions and excretions
with such astonishing rapidity; why the liver so
constantly becomes diseased when highly stimulating
substances, not properly alimentary, are
mixed with the food, and more especially when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
ardent spirits or the stronger wines are largely and
habitually taken; why the sympathy is so intimate
and intense between the stomach and the
liver and the liver and the stomach, both in health
and disease; why in the ascending animal series
the liver so soon appears after the stomach, and
why the magnitude of the organ and the elaborateness
of its structure progressively increase with
the extension of the digestive apparatus and the
corresponding complexity of the general organization.</p>

<p><a id="para_907"></a>907. The second function performed by the
liver is that of excretion. The excrementitious
matter eliminated from the blood by the liver is
contained in its peculiar secretion, the bile. The
bile consists of two portions, an assimilative part
which combines chemically with the chyle, purifying
and exalting its nature; and an excrementitious
part which combines with the residue of
the aliment.</p>

<p><a id="para_908"></a>908. The excrementitious part of the bile contains
a large proportion of carbon and hydrogen.
Carbon and hydrogen abound in venous blood;
venous blood in large quantity is sent to the liver
to afford the materials for the secretion of bile;
consequently, the more copious the secretion of
bile the greater the quantity of carbon and hydrogen
abstracted from venous blood. It follows
that, by this elimination of carbon and hydrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
from the blood, the liver is auxiliary, as an organ
of excretion, to the skin and the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="para_909"></a>909. But it is well worthy of remark, that
although the liver at all times assists the skin and
the lungs in carrying on the process of excretion,
it does this most especially under circumstances
which necessarily enfeeble the action of the cutaneous
and pulmonary organs.</p>

<p><a id="para_910"></a>910. Less carbon is expelled from the lungs in
summer than in winter; at a high than at a low
temperature; consequently by a long-continued
exposure to intense heat, as in the hot months of
summer, and still more by a continual residence
in a warm climate, an accumulation of carbon in
the blood is favoured. A part of this excess is
removed by the increased exhalation from the
skin. The skin, however, is the chief outlet, not
for carbon, but for hydrogen; and accordingly by
the increased perspiration hydrogen is largely
removed. Hydrogen and carbon compose fat.
The deposition of fat, could it go on to the requisite
extent, would afford an adequate consumption
for the superabundant carbon; but the formation
of fat is prevented by the dissipation of the
hydrogen. Under such circumstances, when the
lungs cannot carry off the requisite quantity of
carbon, nor the adipose tissue compensate for its
diminished activity by the deposition of fat, the
liver, taking on an increased action, secretes an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
extraordinary quantity of bile. In this manner
the superfluous carbon, instead of being removed
in the ordinary mode, by the pulmonary artery
through the lungs, under the form of carbonic
acid gas, is excreted by the vena portæ, through
the liver, under the form of bile, while the superabundant
hydrogen is removed by the increased
quantity of perspiration; and thus the accumulation
of these inflammable matters in the system
is effectually prevented.</p>

<p><a id="para_911"></a>911. By the deposition of fat in the adipose
tissue material assistance is afforded to the excretory
action of the skin, the lungs, and the liver.
Fat is composed essentially of carbon and hydrogen;
it contains no nitrogen and very little oxygen.
It is deposited whenever an excessive quantity of
nutritive matter is poured into the blood, and
especially when at the same time the different
secretions and excretions ordinarily formed from
the blood are diminished. The primary object of
this deposition is to relieve the circulation of a
load which would embarrass and ultimately stop
the actions of life. It serves, however, a secondary
purpose, that of forming a storehouse of nutritive
matter, duly prepared for supplying the wants of
the system, in case the body should be placed
under circumstances in which the digestive organs
can no longer receive food or no longer convert it
into chyle.</p>

<p><a id="para_912"></a>912. Thus hybernating animals, which pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
many months without taking food, accumulate a
store of fat before they fall into the state of torpor.
Marmots and dormice subsist on this store during
the winter, and hence, when spring awakens them
from their torpor, they are always in a state of
extreme emaciation. Birds and other animals
which live on food procured with difficulty in the
winter, become unusually fat in the autumn.</p>

<p><a id="para_913"></a>913. During fever and other acute diseases,
when little food is received, and still less converted
into chyle, the extreme emaciation which the body
undergoes is owing partly to the disappearance of
the fat, which is taken up by the absorbents and
carried into the blood, in order to compensate for
the deficiency of nutrient matter supplied by the
digestive organs.</p>

<p><a id="para_914"></a>914. The chief depositories of the fat are
those intersticial spaces of the body in which a
certain quantity of soft but tenaceous substance is
required to obviate pressure or to preserve symmetry.
A large quantity is also placed immediately
beneath the skin; in the interstices of
muscles; along the course of blood-vessels and
nerves; in the omentum, where it is spread
like a covering over the viscera of the abdomen
(fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXX">CLXX</a></span>. 7); in the mesentery and around the
kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="para_915"></a>915. Fat is a bad conductor of heat; consequently
the layer which is spread over the external
surface immediately beneath the skin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
that which is collected in the interior of the
omentum, must be useful in preserving the heat
of the body. Fat persons bear cold better than
lean persons. Animals which inhabit the northern
climates, and the fishes of the frozen seas, are
enveloped in prodigious quantities of fat. Where
the accumulation of this substance would produce
deformity or interfere with function, as about the
joints, in the eyelids, within the skull, not a particle
is ever deposited. About the joints it would
impede motion; in the eyelids it would render the
face hideous and obstruct vision; and within the
skull, a cavity completely filled with the brain, an
organ impatient of the slightest pressure, had a
substance been placed, the quantity of which is
liable to be suddenly trebled or quadrupled,
changes in the system which now produce no inconvenience
would have been fatal. Thus, while
provision is made at once to exonerate the system
from too great a load of nourishment, and to lay
up the superfluous matter, as in a magazine, to be
ready for future use, the most extreme care is
taken to deposit the store in safe and convenient
situations.</p>

<p><a id="para_916"></a>916. The excretory organs and processes,
hitherto considered, have for their object the
removal from the blood of its superfluous carbon
and hydrogen; the element peculiar to the animal
body, azote, is eliminated by the kidneys, glan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>dular
organs which possess a highly complex
structure.</p>

<p><a id="para_917"></a>917. But besides the removal of the superfluous
azote, the fluid secreted by the kidneys
would appear to be a general outlet for whatever
is not required in the system, and for the removal
of which no specific apparatus is provided. Chemical
analysis shows that, in different states of
the system, the following substances are contained
in this fluid:—water, free phosphoric acid, phosphate
of lime, phosphate of magnesia, floric acid,
uric acid, benzoic acid, lactic acid, urea, gelatin,
albumen, lactate of ammonia, sulphate of potash,
sulphate of soda, fluate of lime, muriate of soda,
phosphate of soda, phosphate of ammonia, sulphur,
and silex.</p>

<p><a id="para_918"></a>918. This catalogue itself suggests the idea
that when any matter employed in carrying on
the functions is in excess, or when it has become
decayed, or is decomposed and is not eliminated
by any other excretory process, it is taken up by
the absorbents, poured into the veins, and so
conveyed in the course of the circulation to the
kidneys, by which organs it is separated from the
blood, and thence by an appropriate apparatus
carried out of the system.</p>

<p><a id="para_919"></a>919. The specific matter secreted by the
kidneys is that termed urea; a substance of a
resinous nature, highly animalized. One charac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>ter
by which the animal is distinguished from the
plant is its locomotion. The organ by which the
animal is rendered capable of performing the
function of locomotion is muscle or flesh. The
basis of muscle is fibrin, and the basis of fibrin
azote. There must be in the animal body an
abundant supply of fibrin, and consequently a
proportionate abundance of azote. Azote is introduced
into the system partly by the food and
partly by the lungs. That there may be a sufficiency
for all occasions, more is introduced than is
necessary on ordinary occasions, and a special
outlet is established for the excess through the
kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="para_920"></a>920. Organs appropriated to the removal of
substances from the blood, capable of becoming
deleterious by their accumulation, generally in a
state of health perform their office so perfectly
that the matters which it is their part to excrete
are eliminated almost as quickly as they enter the
blood, so that they are seldom present in the circulating
fluid in sufficient quantity to be detected
by the most delicate chemical tests. But by
the removal of the excretory organ, or by the
suppression of its function, the excretory matter
accumulates in the blood, and is then readily
detected. A decisive experiment disclosed that
this is the case with regard to urea. The kidneys
were removed from a living animal. The operation
did not appear to be productive of material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
injury for some time; but at length symptoms
denoting the presence of a poison in the blood
arose, and the animal died. The blood was
carefully examined after death. It was found to
contain a much larger quantity than ordinary of
the peculiar animal substance which enters into
the composition of the serosity of the blood
(225). On subjecting this substance to the
action of various re-agents, and also on reducing
it to its ultimate elements, it was found to resemble
urea; to be, in fact, nearly identical
with urea as contained in the urine. From this
experiment it became manifest that the source of
the urea is the serosity of the blood. It is probable
that the chief office of the kidney is to separate
the urea from the other ingredients of the
blood, and to convey it to the organs which are
destined to carry it out of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_921"></a>921. It is estimated that about a thousand
ounces of blood pass through the kidneys in the
space of an hour; itself a sufficient indication of
the importance of the excretion performed by this
organ, and an adequate source of the matter actually
excreted, although, under ordinary circumstances,
distributed through the circulating mass
in quantities so minute as to be almost inappreciable.</p>

<p><a id="para_922"></a>922. From the power of absorption possessed
by the veins of the stomach and intestines, from
the connexion proved to be established between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
the venous and absorbent systems, and from the
discovery of Lippi, that several absorbent branches
in the abdomen terminate directly in the pelvis of
the kidney, that is now an established fact which
was long a conjecture, that there exists a short
route from the stomach to the kidneys, so that the
extreme rapidity with which certain substances
mixed with the aliment appear in the fluid secreted
by the kidneys is no longer a matter of wonder.</p>

<p><a id="para_923"></a>923. Out of the body urea putrifies with great
rapidity. When retained in the system by the
extirpation of the kidney, or by placing a ligature
around the ureter, such is the septic tendency
communicated to the blood that signs of putrescency
become manifest even during life, and after
death all the soft parts of the body are reduced to
a state of putrefaction with extreme rapidity.
The suppression of the secretion in the human
body, or the undue retention of the matter secreted,
induces fever of a malignant kind, in which the
symptoms that denote a highly putrid taint in the
system are rapidly developed. But for the labour
of the kidney, then, a substance would accumulate
in the blood, which would quickly lead to the decomposition
of the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_924"></a>924. It has been shown that the mucous
membrane which lines the alimentary canal is
studded in its whole extent with glands, which
secrete from the blood a large quantity of fluid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
These secretions go on without interruption, whether
food be taken or not, so that there may be
copious alvine evacuations though not a particle
of food enter the stomach; and the separation of
the matter eliminated from the blood by this
extended membrane can no more be dispensed
with than that by the skin or the lungs. There
is, too, a most intimate sympathy between the
secretion of the membrane that lines the internal
surface of the body and that carried on by its
external covering; any disorder of the one immediately
and powerfully disturbs the natural course
of the other: hence the diarrhœa, so often produced
by the application of cold to the external
skin, and the diseases of the skin, so constantly
connected with a disordered state of the mucous
membrane of the intestines.</p>

<p><a id="para_925"></a>925. It is the special office of the large intestines
to prepare for its removal, and to carry out
of the system the residue of the aliment, together
with the excrementitious portion of the bile.</p>

<p><a id="para_926"></a>926. It was calculated by Haller, that the different
excretory organs remove from the system every
twenty-four hours twenty pounds of matter. Of
this total loss sustained daily by the human body,
it was estimated that four pounds are removed by
the skin, four pounds by the lungs, four pounds
by the kidneys, and eight pounds by the intestinal
canal. In this estimate, which is considered too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
large, especially that by the intestinal canal, the
quantity stated must be understood as denoting
the maximum of each secretion.</p>

<p><a id="para_927"></a>927. Supposing the ingesta in twenty-four hours
to be of food 6 pounds, or 96 ounces, and of
oxygen retained in the system 4 ounces, in all
100 ounces, it is estimated that the egesta will
be, in twenty-four hours, by the skin, 34 ounces,
by the lungs 17 ounces, by the intestines 6 ounces,
by the kidneys 40 ounces, and by various other
excretions 3 ounces, in all, 100 ounces. These
calculations must of course be taken only as approximations
to the truth, and as ascribing rather
the relative than the positive quantities of matter
excreted.</p>

<p><a id="para_928"></a>928. Whatever be the absolute quantity or the
form of the excretions, it is clear, from the preceding
account, that there is constantly removed
from the system by the skin a large portion of
hydrogen and some carbon; by the lungs a large
portion of carbon and some hydrogen; by the
liver a large portion of hydrogen and some carbon;
by the kidneys a large portion of azote; by
the large intestines the residue of the aliment;
while, by the deposition of fat, the superabundant
nutriment withdrawn from the current of the
circulation is laid up in store in some safe part of
the body.</p>

<p><a id="para_929"></a>929. Most of the processes which have been described
are mutually compensating and vicarious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
Besides the office which each habitually performs,
it is capable of having its action occasionally increased,
for the purpose of supplying the deficiency
of one or more of its fellows. If perspiration by
the skin languish, transudation by the lungs increases;
if neither the skin nor the lungs be able
to remove the superfluous hydrogen and carbon,
these inflammable substances are carried out of
the system by the liver in an augmented secretion
of bile. If the action of the liver be diminished, that
of the kidney is increased; and if the secretion of
urine be suppressed, the secretion of bile is augmented.
When the absorbents are oppressed by
the quantity of fluid poured into the stomach, or
when the system is at the point of saturation,
and no absorption can go on, the veins take up
the superfluous liquids, pour them into the circulating
current, and bear them to the kidneys, by
which organs they are rapidly separated from the
blood, and carried out of the body. The weakness
of one organ is compensated by the strength
of another; the diminished activity of one process
is equalized by the increased energy of some other
to which it is allied in nature and linked by sympathy;
and thus the evils which would result
from the partial and temporary failure of an important
function are obviated by some vicarious
labour, until the enfeebled organ has recovered its
tone, and the natural balance of the functions is
restored.</p>

<p><a id="para_930"></a>930. The condition acquired by the elementary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
particles of organized bodies, from their long
continuance in the system, which induces the
necessity for their excretion, is not known. The
chemical elements of the excretions are the very
same as those which constitute the organized textures
and the nourishment by which they are sustained.
Carbon is the basis of the organized
body; yet all living bodies, without exception,
excrete carbon. Oxygen, hydrogen, and azote,
also, without which life cannot be maintained, if
retained in the system beyond a given time, are
incompatible with the continuance of life. During
the chemical changes which these elementary
particles undergo, in the course of the vital processes,
they appear to enter into some combination,
which is no longer compatible with the peculiar
mode in which they are disposed in organized
and living structures. And one such change,
of a very remarkable nature, has been observed,
which, it is conceived, has a considerable share in
rendering their constant expulsion and renovation
indispensable.</p>

<p><a id="para_931"></a>931. Out of the condition of life the component
elements of organized bodies readily combine
so as to form crystals; the peculiar combinations
by which they form the constituent textures of
organic structures are never crystalline. No
crystal is ever seen in the seat of a living and
growing vegetable cellule; no crystal is ever
found as a constituent part of animal membrane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
Whenever a crystal occurs in an organized body
it is always the result either of disease or of some
artificial process, or else it is an excretion separated
from the nourishing fluid and the useful textures.
Every one of these textures contains, even in its
minutest parts, saline and earthy, as well as vegetable
or animal, matter. Why do not these saline
and earthy particles as readily combine to form
crystals in the organic as they do in the inorganic
body? They never do. In the organic body these
saline and earthy particles are always so arranged
that they are diffused through the membranous
fibres or cells, never concentrated in crystals.</p>

<p><a id="para_932"></a>932. On the other hand, the elements containing
the peculiar matters of excretion are
generally in such a state of combination as readily
to assume the crystalline form, either alone or in
the simplest further combinations of which they
are susceptible. It seems probable that this circumstance
may be, at least in part, the cause which
necessitates their expulsion, and it is certain that
some such general principle must determine the
incompatibility of the matters of excretion with
the life of the structures</p>

<p><a id="para_933"></a>933. The ultimate object of the processes included
in the function of excretion is to maintain
the nutritive fluid in a certain chemical condition.
Into the combination of the blood there must
enter certain constituents, and these must be in
certain relative proportions, and in no others. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the salts be diminished or in excess, if the fibrin,
or the red particles, or the serum be abundant or
defective beyond a certain degree, either the necessary
chemical elements are not present, or not
present in the form necessary to their entering
into the requisite combinations; the result is,
that a proper nutritive fluid is not formed, and
consequently due nourishment is not afforded to
the textures nor due stimulus to the moving
powers; there is either too much nutriment and
stimulus or too little; in the one case the machine
is exhausted and worn out, and in the other it is
clogged and stopped.</p>

<p><a id="para_934"></a>934. The capillary arteries of the skin, and of
all the other tissues into the composition of which
gelatin enters as a constituent, necessarily pour
carbon into the capillary veins at the moment
they convert albumen into gelatin (<a href="#para_539">539</a>). The
veins, receiving in their course more and more
carbon from the arteries, at length become loaded
with this element, and in order to get rid of the
excess they bear it to the lungs, where it is expelled
by the act of expiration under the form of carbonic
acid gas. On the other hand the chyle, gradually
becoming firmer and more condensed by the series
of changes which it undergoes from its first formation
in the duodenum to its admixture with the
lymph in the receptacle of the chyle, and with the
blood in the subclavian vein, is hurried to the
heart and thence to the lungs, where it gives off a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
large portion of its watery particles, also by the
act of expiration, under the form of aqueous
vapour. This excretion of its watery particles is a
necessary part of the process of completion by
which the weak albumen of the chyle is converted
into the strong albumen of the blood (703. 3).
How completely analogous then is this excretory
process in the plant and in the animal! How
precisely the same is the action of the leaf and of
the lung! The leaf dissipates the superfluous
water of the crude sap, concentrates its organic
principles, and brings it into the chemical condition
which constitutes the proper juice of the
plant; the lung removes the superfluous water of
the chyle, concentrates its organic principles, and
completely assimilates its chemical nature into
that of the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_935"></a>935. It is the same with every other process of
excretion; its uniform result is to alter the chemical
composition of the nutritive fluid, to restore
it to a state of concentration and purity. Excretion
then is appropriately termed a depurating
process.</p>

<p><a id="para_936"></a>936. The effect of the suppression of excretion,
when the suppression is complete, is appalling.
Stop the respiration, that is, suspend the depurating
action of the lungs, carbon accumulates in the
venous blood; carbon mixes with the arterial
blood; in half a minute the blood flowing in the
arteries is evidently darkened; in three-quarters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
a minute it is of a dusky hue; in a minute and a
half it is quite black; every particle of arterial
blood has now disappeared, and the whole mass is
become venous. With the first appearance of the
dusky hue great disturbance is produced in the
system; the instant it becomes dark sensibility is
abolished; in a few minutes after it is black the
power of the heart is so enfeebled that it can no
longer carry on the circulation, and in a few
minutes more its action wholly ceases, and can
never again be excited. The brain feels the poison
first, and is first killed; but the heart cannot long
resist the fatal influence.</p>

<p><a id="para_937"></a>937. Stop the excretion of the kidney by the
extirpation of the organ, or the suppression of its
secretion, urea accumulates in the blood; the
poison, after a short time, begins to work; fever is
excited, and then, with fearful rapidity, fever is
followed by coma, and coma by death.</p>

<p><a id="para_938"></a>938. Stop the secretion of bile, a poison accumulates
in the blood as potent, producing insensibility
and death as rapidly, as that generated
by the suppression of the depurating action of the
kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="para_939"></a>939. Only obstruct the secretion of bile, merely
prevent its due elimination from the blood, just in
proportion to its suppression does the system
suffer from languor, lassitude, and inaptitude for
every muscular and mental exertion.</p>

<p><a id="para_940"></a>940. How do the internal organs suffer when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
the excretion of the skin is deficient, and how
numberless and hideous are the diseases of the skin
when the depurating process of the alimentary
canal is suspended!</p>

<p><a id="para_941"></a>941. When, on the contrary, all these excretions
are well and duly performed, how regular and
tranquil, yet how full and strong the flow of the circulating
current; how rich the stream poured by it
into every organ; how healthfully exciting its influence
on them all; how gentle, how efficient, every
organic action; how complete the absence of all
note or sensible intimation that any such action is
going on, yet how delicious the consciousness produced
by its soundness and vigour; how acute the
sense, how bounding the motion, how quick the
percipience; how the pure blood mantles in the
cheek and diffuses its sparkling colour over all
the transparent complexion; how the jocund
spirits laugh from the eyes; how the intellectual
and sympathizing mind beams forth from them
with a higher and holier happiness! How wonderfully
beautiful is such a human body, and how
magnificently endowed in its capacity to give and
to receive enjoyment!</p>

<p><a id="para_942"></a>942. There are two adjustments, with regard
to the excretions, carried on by organized bodies,
which can never be contemplated with sufficient
admiration. It has been fully shown (464 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>)
that the relation established between the two great
classes of organized beings is such that the ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>crementitious
matter of the plant is nutritious
to the animal, and the excrementitious matter
of the animal is nutritious to the plant; and,
consequently, that the two orders of living beings
maintain the world, which is given them as their
inheritance, in a state of perpetual adaptation for
the life and health of each other; the animal
receiving healthy stimulation from that which is
poisonous to the plant, and the plant being
nourished by particles which the animal throws off
as exhausted and useless. And this relation
naturally suggests that so beautifully described by
Milton:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent14">Flow’rs and their fruit,</div>
   <div class="verse">Man’s nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed</div>

   <div class="verse">To intellectual; give both life and sense,</div>
   <div class="verse">Fancy and understanding; whence the soul</div>
   <div class="verse">Reason receives.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="para_943"></a>943. Secondly, the particles thrown off by
organized bodies are rendered, in the very act of
their dissipation, subservient to purposes of utility
and pleasure. How these poisonous elements are
converted into the pabulum of life and health has
been shown. To a being with the senses and
faculties of man, how loathsome might these
particles have been rendered during the period of
their transition from one organized kingdom to
the other! And if disagreeable at all, how constantly
forced upon his sense, wherever he might
be, during every moment of his waking hours,
must these objects of disgust have been! But how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
does the matter actually stand? The excretions of
the plant are the very particles that, poured</p>

<p>create “a wilderness of sweets.” It is as these
exhalations are passing off from the economy to
which, if retained, they would be noxious (<a href="#para_851">851</a>),
that they become</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent4">“Exhalations of all sweets</div>

<p>and which refresh and delight even more than the
forms and colours of the “aery leaf” or “the
bright consummate flower.”</p>

<p><a id="para_944"></a>944. And the human body, when the functions
of its economy are sound and vigorous, is
fresh and fragrant as the flower (<a href="#para_862">862</a>); and by
that intellectual faculty by which man is capable
of associating his conception of beauty and delight
with whatever object has been the source of exquisite
gratification, the fragrance of the flower is
but suggestive of what, to him, is inexpressibly
sweeter and dearer.</p>

<p><a id="para_945"></a>945. The object of the greater part of the
processes hitherto described is to form the nutri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>tive
fluid, and to bring it to the requisite state of
purity and strength. Recent researches into the
composition of the nutritive fluid confirm the
general correctness of the account already given
of it, (211 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>).</p>

<p><a id="para_946"></a>946. When examined as it is flowing in the
finest vessels of a transparent part of the body,
or immediately after it is abstracted from the
trunk of a vein or artery, before coagulation
(218) takes place, the blood is seen to consist of
a colourless fluid, through which is diffused a
countless number of minute solid particles of a
red colour. The colourless fluid is called the
liquor sanguinis, and the solid particles the blood
corpuscles or the red particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_947"></a>947. By the process of coagulation, the phenomena
of which have been fully described
(219 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>), the blood spontaneously separates
into a clear fluid of a yellow colour called serum
or blood-water, and into a solid mass termed the
clot or the crassamentum. The serum, which
must be carefully distinguished from the liquor
sanguinis, is the fluid formed from the blood by
coagulation; the liquor sanguinis is the fluid part
of the blood which exists before coagulation.</p>

<p><a id="para_948"></a>948. The liquor sanguinis contains in solution
a large quantity of animal matter, fibrin (228),
which separates spontaneously in a solid form on
coagulation; the serum also contains a quantity of
animal matter in solution, albumen (224), which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
does not separate in a solid form spontaneously,
but only on the application of heat, acids, alcohol,
&amp;c. (224). The animal matter, the fibrin, which
separates spontaneously from the liquor sanguinis
in a solid form, constitutes one part of the clot,
and the other part of it consists of the red particles
which floated in the liquor sanguinis.</p>

<p><a id="para_949"></a>949. Thus, by coagulation, the liquor sanguinis
separates into a portion which remains
fluid, the serum; and into a portion which becomes
solid, the fibrin; while the fibrin, as it is passing
from the fluid to the solid state, entangles the red
particles, and both together form the clot; consequently
the liquor sanguinis contains in solution
two kinds of solid matter, fibrin and albumen;
while the serum contains in solution only one
kind of solid matter, albumen.</p>

<p><a id="para_950"></a>950. The solution of fibrin in the liquor sanguinis,
and its spontaneous solidification during
the process of coagulation, has been shown by
Professor Müller in the following mode. Having
carefully collected blood from the femoral artery
of the frog, and also from the heart laid bare and
incised, and having brought a drop of this pure
blood under the microscope, and diluted it with
serum, so that the red particles were separated
from each other by distant intervals, he observed
that there formed in those intervals a coagulation
of previously dissolved matter, by which the separated
red particles were connected together. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
raising, with a needle, the coagulum occupying
the intervening spaces, this solid matter was
obtained free from red particles. The blood corpuscles
of the frog are rendered, by a powerful
microscope, so large, that this operation may be
performed with the greatest distinctness. In consequence
of the minuteness of the red particles of
human blood they pass, with the liquor sanguinis,
through filtering-paper; but those of the frog,
being four times larger, are kept back by the
filter, while the liquor sanguinis percolates through
as a clear fluid, and then coagulates. This colourless
coagulum is so transparent that it is not even
detected, after its formation, until it is raised out
of the fluid with a needle. It gradually thickens
and becomes white. It is the fibrin of the blood
in its purest state.</p>

<p><a id="para_951"></a>951. Professor Müller’s account of the structure
of the red particles differs in a material point
from that given (231 <i lang="la">et seq.</i>). He agrees that
they are rounded bodies (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CXII.</span> 1), generally
of the same size, though some are seen larger
than common, but never double the mean diameter;
that they are always quite flat (232); that
in a certain light they look as if they were hollowed
out from the edges to the centre (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase">CXII. </span> 1); but, he adds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span> “that this spot is a real
depression, as some think, appears to me in the
highest degree improbable; for I have at last
convinced myself that the blood corpuscles of
man and the mammalia contain a very small
nucleus of the diameter of the flat corpuscle.
My observations prove beyond doubt that the
blood corpuscles of frogs and salamanders (fig.
<span class="smcap lowercase">CXII. </span> 4) contain a nucleus entirely different in its
chemical relations from the outer layer. With
one of Frauenhofer’s microscopes I have seen very
distinctly, in the blood corpuscles of man an
exceedingly small, round, well-defined nucleus,
yellower and brighter than the transparent circumference.
When the blood corpuscles are
mixed, under the microscope, with acetic acid,
the shell is almost entirely dissolved, and these
small nuclei, which are seen with great difficulty
in human blood, remain, while those of the frog
appear, very evidently the nuclei observed earlier
in the blood corpuscles. In man, the nuclei
within the corpuscles are so small, that the diameter
does not exceed the thickness of the flat
corpuscles.”</p>

<p><a id="para_952"></a>952. The enveloping capsule is stated to be
soluble in water, while the internal nucleus is insoluble;
but the capsule is not soluble in serum;
the albumen and the salts contained in the serum
probably rendering it insoluble. The colouring
matter of the capsule, which gives the red colour
to the blood, is called hæmatosin. Lecanu considers
the capsular substance as a combination of a
specific colouring matter, which he calls globulin,
and of albumen; but Müller regards it as fibrin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
containing a quantity of iron. The latter physiologist
states that the opinion of Brande, that the
amount of iron in hæmatosin is not greater than
in serum and other animal substances, has been
refuted by Berzelius and Engelhart. The iron is
not an accidental ingredient obtained from the
food; for iron has been found in the blood of a
new-born animal that has never even sucked.
According to Berzelius the colouring matter of the
blood contains a quantity of iron corresponding to
somewhat more than a half per cent. its weight of
metallic iron, and he thinks it most probable that
the iron exists in the blood in the metallic state,
and not as an oxide.</p>

<p><a id="para_953"></a>953. By carefully watching the development
of the chick in the incubated egg, the first formation
of the red particles can be distinctly seen.
The blood in the new being, which is elaborated
before the existence of the vessels that are to contain
it, is formed from the substance of the germ
or from that of the germinal membrane, and is
augmented by the blood of the egg, which is the
substance of the yolk. First, a number of granules
are produced from the substance of the
yolk. These subsequently lose their granular
appearance, and become translucent. On the
translucent ring is produced the nucleus of the
blood corpuscles. When completely formed, the
blood corpuscles of the bird, as of all the animals
below the bird in the scale of organization,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
are of an elliptical figure, and quite flat (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CXII.</span>
4, 5); but when first produced they are rounded
globules, not flat, and they gradually assume their
proper and permanent form; it is only on the sixth
day of incubation that they begin to be elliptical,
by the ninth day they are all elliptical (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase">CXII.</span>
4, 5).</p>

<p><a id="para_954"></a>954. The substance of the fluid yolk is thus
changed into blood without the action of any special
organ; for, as yet, no organs such as liver,
spleen, or lungs, exist. When the formation of
the blood has arrived at a certain point, it begins
to be in motion. The blood is seen to be in motion
before the heart can be observed to beat.
The germinal membrane arising out of the enlarged
germinal disk soon exhibits a thin upper layer
(serous membrane) and a thicker under layer
(mucous membrane). There is also formed in
the middle of the germinal membrane around the
appearing trace of the embryo a translucent space,
the <i lang="la">area pellucida</i>. The exterior of the germinal
membrane remains opaque, and this opaque portion
becomes divided by a definite boundary into
an external and internal annular space in from
sixteen to twenty hours. This separation encloses
one part of the opaque portion of the germinal
membrane, which surrounds the interior or
translucent space of the germinal membrane, and
is termed <i lang="la">area vasculosa</i>, because the blood and
vessels form the inner half of this space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

<p><a id="para_955"></a>955. As far as the area vasculosa extends, a
granular layer is presented between the two layers
of the germinal membrane, which soon divides
into numerous granular isolated particles with
translucent intervals, in which the blood collects,
first in the form of a yellowish, and then of a
reddish fluid; first distinctly in the periphery of
the area vasculosa, from which it is seen to flow
towards the heart before the heart beats.</p>

<p><a id="para_956"></a>956. The blood exerts its vivifying influence
chiefly by the red particles. If an animal be
bled to fainting, and pure serum be injected into
its vessels, re-animation does not take place; but
if the blood of another animal of the same species
be injected, the animal which was apparently dead
acquires new life at every stroke.</p>

<p><a id="para_957"></a>957. The fibrin may be removed from the
blood without injuring the red particles. If the
fibrin be abstracted, and a mixture of the red particles
and the serum be brought to a proper temperature,
and injected into the veins of an animal
bled to fainting, re-animation is effected.</p>

<p><a id="para_958"></a>958. If the blood of an animal of another species
be injected whose red particles are of the same
form, but of a different size, re-animation is indeed
effected, but the restoration is imperfect; the
organic functions are oppressed, and languish, and
death takes place generally within the sixth day.
The same effects follow, if a mixture of serum and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
red particles of the blood of a different species be
injected.</p>

<p><a id="para_959"></a>959. If blood with circular particles be injected
into the vessels of an animal whose blood
corpuscles are elliptical, the most violent effects are
instantly produced; such blood acts upon the
nervous system like the strongest poisons; and
death usually follows with extreme rapidity after
the injection of a very small quantity. Thus, if a
few drops of the blood of the sheep be injected
into the vessels of the bird, the bird is killed instantaneously.
It is very remarkable, that the
blood of the mammalia should be thus fatal to the
bird. The effect cannot be dependent on any mechanical
principle. The injection of a fluid with
particles, the diameter of which is greater than
that of the capillary blood-vessels would of course
destroy life by stopping the circulation; but the
blood corpuscles of the mammalia are much
smaller than those of the bird; yet the pigeon is
killed by a few drops of mammiferous blood; and
the blood of the fish is rapidly fatal to all the
mammalia as well as to birds.</p>

<p><a id="para_960"></a>960. It is manifest, both from observation and
experiment, that arterial blood is far more necessary
to the support of the animal than of the
organic life. When in asphyxia the communication
of atmospheric air with the lungs is suspended,
the functions of the brain are abolished;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
sensibility and voluntary motion are lost the moment
venous blood circulates in the arteries of the
brain. It has been shown (<a href="#para_476">476</a>), that if this
state continue, the animal life is destroyed in a
minute and a half; but that the organic life is not
extinguished for many minutes, and sometimes
not even for several hours.</p>

<p><a id="para_961"></a>961. It sometimes happens that the communication
between the pulmonary artery and the
aorta, and between the right and left auricle,
which naturally exist in the fœtus, is continued
after birth. In persons having this state of the
circulation, called ceruleans, some portion of
venous blood is always mixed with arterial blood.
In this case the various processes of secretion and
nutrition, the entire circle of organic functions, are
but little disturbed; while the animal functions
are deranged in a remarkable degree. The mind
is weak and inactive, and the muscular power is
so feeble, that the least exertion produces a sense
of suffocation; and, if the muscular effort be continued,
occasions fainting, and even suspended
animation.</p>

<p><a id="para_962"></a>962. But while venous blood is in no case
capable of supporting sensation and voluntary
motion, there are decided cases in which secretion
is effected, at least in part, from venous blood, as
the bile from the venous blood that circulates
through the liver in man and all the mammalia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
and the urine which is formed from venous blood
in some of the lower orders of animals.</p>

<p><a id="para_963"></a>963. The proper nutritive fluid of the human
body is directly formed from chyle, lymph, and
venous blood; that is, partly from new matter introduced
into the system from the external world,
and partly from matter which has already formed
a constituent part of the body. The new matter,
the white chyle, is prepared partly by the action
of the digestive fluids upon the food, and partly
by the addition to the digested food of highly
animalized substances, endowed with assimilative
properties, by which the product is progressively
approximated to the chemical composition of the
blood. The old matter consists partly of the clear
lymph, contained in the lymph vessels, and derived
from the interior of the organized parts,
particles which have already formed an integrant
portion of the tissues and organs; and partly of
the dark venous blood, the residue of the proper
nutritive fluid, after the latter has yielded to the
system the new matter required by it, and has
given off from the system its superfluous and
noxious particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_964"></a>964. In the duodenum and jejunum the new
matter, the chyle, contains albumen; but it is
without coagulable fibrin: it acquires fibrin in the
lymph vessels on its way to the veins.</p>

<p><a id="para_965"></a>965. In the chyle globules appear; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
chyle corpuscles are white, are without an external
envelop, are comparatively few in number, are
somewhat more than half the size of the blood
corpuscles, and, like the nuclei of the latter, are
insoluble in water.</p>

<p><a id="para_966"></a>966. The fatty or oleaginous matter contained
in the chyle is in a free state, not intimately combined.</p>

<p><a id="para_967"></a>967. The chyle is alkaline, but is much less
alkaline than the blood; and the iron contained in
the chyle is much less intimately combined than it
is in the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_968"></a>968. Lymph contains in solution more animal
matter than chyle, and the white globules are
more abundant in lymph. But though lymph
contain in solution more albumen and fibrin than
chyle, it is not so richly loaded with these substances
as blood. Still, however, the solution of
albumen and fibrin in lymph approximates lymph
so closely to the blood, that the lymph very much
resembles the clear liquor sanguinis of which the
blood consists when the red particles are abstracted
from it. The colourless liquor sanguinis
is the lymph of the blood. Lymph is blood without
red particles; and blood, lymph with red particles.</p>

<p><a id="para_969"></a>969. The chyle is transmitted into the lymph-vessels
to mingle with the lymph before it flows
into the veins to mingle with the blood.</p>

<p><a id="para_970"></a>970. The commingled fluids, chyle and lymph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
pass into the blood very slowly, drop by drop.
The regulation of the rapidity of the admixture
seems to be the chief office of the valve placed at
the termination of the thoracic duct. When the
operation is observed in a living animal, it is seen
that this valve prevents the new matter from flowing
into the blood in a full stream. If in a dog
of ordinary size that has recently eaten as much
animal food as it chose, the thoracic duct be
opened in the neck, the dog being alive, there will
flow from the duct about half an ounce of fluid in
five minutes (<a href="#para_831">831</a>); yet when this fluid reaches
the termination of the duct only a few inches further
on, it flows into the vein only drop by drop,
at considerable intervals. One great object of
pouring the chyle and lymph into the venous system
so close to the heart (fig. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fig_CLXXVIII">CLXXVIII</a>.</span>), and of causing
the commingled fluid to pass under the action of
that powerful engine before it is transmitted to the
lungs, seems to be, by the agitation to which it is
subjected in the right auricle and ventricle to accomplish
the most perfect admixture possible between
the particles of the chyle and lymph and
the red particles of the venous blood; an object
which would be counteracted by the too rapid
entrance into the current of the circulation of the
new and as yet imperfectly assimilated matter.</p>

<p><a id="para_971"></a>971. After their due admixture by the powerful
action of the engine that works the circulation,
the commingled fluids are transmitted by the right
heart to the lungs. There the watery portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
the chyle and lymph is removed; the composition
of the albumen and fibrin is completed, these substances
being changed from a weak and loose into
a strong and concentrated state; the solid particles
are increased in number, augmented in size,
and changed from a white into a red colour;
carbon is given off; oxygen is absorbed; azote is
alternately inhaled and exhaled; and the ultimate
result is, that the three fluids—chyle, lymph, and
venous blood—are converted into one homogeneous
fluid, arterial blood, the proper nutrient fluid.</p>

<p><a id="para_972"></a>972. The particles of the chyle and lymph, on
mingling with the blood, are scattered through the
mass, and become invisible, being apparently lost
among the innumerable red corpuscles; but it is
not probable that the chyle is immediately converted
into blood. If the coagulation of the blood
be retarded by the addition of a small portion of
the carbonate of potass, the red particles gradually
sink some lines below the level of the fluid; and
the supernatent liquid is whitish, evidently from
the chylous globules mingled with the blood. In
ordinary coagulation, the chyle globules are included
among the immense number of the red
particles of the coagulum, and are thus indistinguishable;
but there is reason to believe that the
chyle is not converted into blood under at least
from ten to twelve hours; it is certain, that in that
space of time after the completion of digestion,
the serum of the blood is frequently seen to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
milk-white, from the quantity of unassimilated
chyle still contained in it.</p>

<p><a id="para_973"></a>973. How the red colour of the blood is obtained,
and whence the capsules of the red particles
are derived, if these bodies really possess an
external envelop, is wholly unknown. But it has
been shown (953 and 955) that in incubation the
blood is formed from the substance of the fluid
yolk, without the action of any special organ;
that at the period when the blood is first generated,
no such organs as appear to influence the production
of the blood in the adult are in existence;
it is, therefore, reasonable to infer that the formation
of blood in the adult may not be so dependent
on the action of special organs as is commonly
supposed; and that the formation of blood from
chyle, of blood corpuscles from chyle corpuscles,
may take place at all periods of life under the influence
of the same general vital conditions as it
does in the incubated egg.</p>

<p><a id="para_974"></a>974. What change the matter of the blood undergoes
by respiration, whether it acquire something
without which it is incapable of maintaining
life, or part with something the presence of which
is incompatible with life, is equally unknown. We
only know that the blood, during respiration,
changes its colour; but of the nature of the change
produced upon its substance we are wholly ignorant.
In the present state of our knowledge, the
ultimate fact is, that without the change wrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
upon the blood by respiration, the blood is incapable
of maintaining life; in fact, no proper nutrient
fluid is formed.</p>

<p><a id="para_975"></a>975. Once formed, the conservation of the
proper proportions of the composition of the blood
is effected by the excretory processes already described;
by the removal of its superfluous water
by the lungs, skin, and kidneys; by the removal
of its superfluous carbon, azote, and oxygen by the
lungs, liver, and kidneys; by the removal of saline
and mineral matters chiefly by the kidneys; and
finally by the instantaneous removal of products of
decomposition formed in the course of the organic
actions, chiefly, it would appear, by the kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="para_976"></a>976. Once formed, and duly concentrated and
purified, the blood is sent out by the left heart to
the system. Driven by the heart through the main
trunks and branches of the aorta, the blood ultimately
reaches the capillary arteries, which do
not divide and subdivide indefinitely, but ultimately
reach a point beyond which they no longer
diminish in size. Not all of the same magnitude,
some are large enough to admit of three or four
of the red particles of the blood abreast; the diameter
of others is only sufficient to admit of two
or even of one; others are capable of transmitting
only the clear and transparent liquor sanguinis;
while in many cases the membranous tunics of the
capillaries wholly disappear; the blood no longer
flows in actual vessels, but is contained in the sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>stance
of the tissues in channels which it forms in
them for itself (304).</p>

<p><a id="para_977"></a>977. Under the microscope, says Müller, the
blood corpuscles are seen distinctly pouring from
the smallest ramifying arteries into vessels which
grow no smaller. After leaving these, they again
assemble in the origins of veins formed in collected
branches. The blood corpuscles flow in the
finest capillaries, one after another, and often interruptedly.
They are colourless when they flow
singly; accumulated more thickly, they appear
yellow, and in still greater quantity, yellowish red
or red. In animals that have lost their strength,
the globules flow without stoppage: when the
animal is weak and the motion is retarded, the
globules move by starts; they move on, but go
more rapidly by fits. In a still weaker animal
they only advance during the impulse of the heart,
and then fall back a little. When several arterial
currents unite in an anastomosis, one current
always predominates and traverses the anastomosis
alone, to mingle its blood in the other currents.
Thus the currents meet and divide in the reticulate
capillaries till all are collected again in veins.
Sometimes the direction of the current changes,
when another current becomes stronger, and the
previous leader weaker, according to the pressure
exerted on the part.</p>

<p><a id="para_978"></a>978. While the blood is thus traversing the
capillaries, its colour changes from a bright scarlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
to a dark red. This change in the colour of the
blood is the certain sign that particles have been
abstracted from the circulating mass, and have
been applied to the formation and support of the
fluid and solid parts through which the stream is
flowing. Some physiologists have satisfied themselves
that they have seen the actual escape of
particles from the circulating current; that they
have witnessed the immediate combination of those
particles with the substance of the tissues, and
even that they have beheld other particles quitting
the tissues and mingling with the flowing blood.
Other physiologists doubt whether the most patient
observation, aided by the most skilful management
of the best glasses, can ever have rendered such
phenomena matters of sense. “I imagined,” says
Müller, “at an early period, that I had seen
something like this in the setting circulation; but
by prolonging the observation I saw the globules
move on if the current continued.”</p>

<p><a id="para_979"></a>979. But whether the human eye have ever
actually seen or not an interchange of particles
between the blood and the tissues, it is absolutely
certain that such an interchange does take place.
For,—</p>

<p>1. Indubitable evidence has been stated (786, <i lang="la">et
seq.</i>) of continual absorption from all parts of the
body, yet there is no loss of substance; there must
therefore of necessity be a proportionate deposition.</p>

<p>2. Equal evidence has been adduced (<a href="#para_688">688</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
that constant additions are made to the blood
through the organs of digestion, yet the quantity
of the blood in the body does not progressively and
permanently increase; it follows that a quantity
must be abstracted from the blood proportionate to
the quantity added to it.</p>

<p>3. The human germ, from a scarcely visible
point, by the successive additions of new matter
progressively acquires the bulk of the adult man.</p>

<p>4. Organs whose special office it is to abstract
particles from the blood for the elaboration of
specific secretions consist almost entirely of congeries
of blood-vessels. The agents are multiplied in
proportion to the extent of the labour assigned them.</p>

<p>5. Growth, which is merely excess of deposition
above absorption, is active in proportion to the
quantity of blood which circulates through the
growing part in a given time. The blood-vessels
of a growing part increase in number and augment
in size is proportion to the rapidity of the growth.
In morbid growth, it is sometimes sufficient to stop
the process merely to tie the main trunks of the
arteries distributed to the part.</p>

<p><a id="para_980"></a>980. By every organ and every tissue; by the
membrane, the muscle, the bone; by the brain,
the heart, the liver, the lungs, particles are abstracted
from the countless streams that bathe
them, or that flow through them. In every case
in which particles are thus abstracted by a tissue
the following phenomena take place:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<p>1. Only those constituents of the blood are abstracted
by the tissue which are of the same chemical
nature as its own.</p>

<p>2. The constituents of the blood abstracted by a
tissue, identical in chemical composition with its
own, are immediately incorporated into its substance.</p>

<p>3. The constituents of the blood abstracted by a
tissue, as they are incorporated into its substance,
are not disposed fortuitously, but are arranged
according to the specific organization of the tissue,
and thus receive its own peculiar structure.</p>

<p>4. The constituents of the blood which thus
receive the peculiar organization and structure of
the tissue by which they are appropriated, acquire
all its peculiar vital endowments.</p>

<p><a id="para_981"></a>981. It is manifest, then, that the tissues
assimilate the blood just as the digestive fluids
assimilate the aliment. And this is nutrition, the
assimilation of the blood by the tissues and organs.
Digestion is the conversion of the food into blood;
nutrition is the conversion of blood into living
fluids and solids.</p>

<p><a id="para_982"></a>982. For the reasons assigned (757 and 758),
it is probable that the living fluids and solids,
formed from the blood by the act of nutrition, are
not generated at the parts of the body where they
appear, but that, pre-existing in the blood, they
are merely evolved at those parts. Hence the
variety and complexity of the processes for the
elaboration of the blood which have been described,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
and all of which appear to be indispensable to
bring the blood to a proper state of purity and
strength. The great effort of the system is put
forth in effecting the constitution of the blood.
When the blood is once formed, all the rest of the
work appears to be easy; because, before it reaches
any part of the organization which it is destined
to support, the blood is already adapted, mechanically,
chemically, and vitally, to afford that support.
Still since there are cases, as in the production of
gelatin, in which the substance does not appear to
be pre-existent in the blood, we are under the
necessity of supposing that a material change is
effected in the constituents of the vital fluid at the
time and place of their escape from the circulation.</p>

<p><a id="para_983"></a>983. How the constituents of the blood escape
from the circulation and incorporate themselves
with the substance of the tissues there can be no
difficulty in conceiving, wherever the capillaries
terminate in membraneless canals, channels worked
out for the reception of the nutrient stream by the
force of the current itself; and in every case in
which the capillaries, retaining their membranous
tunics, remain true and proper vessels, their contents
escape through their delicate walls by the
process of endosmose (<a href="#para_803">803</a>), for which their
structure appears to be admirably adapted.</p>

<p><a id="para_984"></a>984. But in the capillary vessels there exists
only blood. Universally and invariably before the
blood passes from under the influence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
capillary vessels it has ceased to be blood. Arterial
blood is conveyed by the carotid artery to the
brain; but the cerebral arteries do not deposit
blood, but brain. Arterial blood is conveyed by
the capillary arteries to bone; but the osseous
capillaries do not deposit blood, but bone. Arterial
blood is conveyed by the muscular arteries to
muscle, but the muscular capillaries do not deposit
blood but muscle. The blood conveyed by
the capillaries of brain, bone, and muscle is the
same; all comes alike from the systemic heart,
and is alike conveyed to all tissues; yet in the one
it becomes brain, in the other bone, and in the
third muscle. Out of one and the same fluid are
manufactured cuticle, and membrane, and muscle,
and brain, and bone; the tears, the wax, the fat,
the saliva, the gastric juice, the milk, the bile, all
the fluids, and all the solids of the body (310).</p>

<p><a id="para_985"></a>985. These phenomena are wholly inexplicable
on any known mechanical principles. It is
equally impossible to refer them to mere chemical
agency, or to any properties of dead matter. We
are therefore under the necessity of referring them
to a principle which, for the sake of distinguishing
it from anything mechanical or chemical, we term
vital. As the actions which take place between
the integrant particles of bodies, giving rise to
chemical phenomena, are referred to one general
principle, termed chemical affinity, so the actions
which take place in living bodies, giving rise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
vital phenomena, may be referred to one general
principal, termed vital affinity. The term explains
nothing, it is true, it merely expresses the general
fact; but still it is convenient to have a term for
the expression of the fact. The property itself
will ever remain an ultimate fact in physiology,
however exactly the limits of its agency, and the
laws according to which it modifies the mechanical
and chemical relations of the substances subjected
to its influence, may hereafter be ascertained; just
as chemical affinity will ever be an ultimate fact in
physics, whatever discoveries may yet be made of
the extent of its agency and of the conditions on
which its action depends.</p>

<p><a id="para_986"></a>986. It is then an ascertained fact, that there
exists between the blood and the tissues a mutual
reaction, not of a physical, but of a vital nature,
in which the blood takes as active a part as the
tissue, and the tissue as the blood; the blood
exerting a vital attraction on the tissue, and the
tissue on the blood. We only express this ultimate
fact when we say (and this is all we can do) that
in every part of the body, by virtue of a vital
affinity, the tissue attracts from the blood the
molecules of matter appropriate to its chemical
composition, and the blood attracts from the tissue
the particles which, having served their purpose
there, are destined to other uses in the economy;
or, if wholly useless, are absorbed into the current
of the circulation to be expelled from the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

<p><a id="para_987"></a>987. We can see how the particles of matter
which are attracted by the tissue from the blood
are so deposited and disposed that the tissue always
preserves its own shape, bulk, and relation to the
surrounding tissues. This definite arrangement is
the result of an action which has been already
stated to be proper to the absorbent vessels. Previously
to the deposition of a new particle of matter
by a capillary, an old particle is removed by an
absorbent, either a lymphatic or a vein. In removing
the old matter, the absorbent forms a mould
into which the capillary deposits the new molecules;
and the form of every tissue and organ
depends on the kind of mould formed for the
reception of its nutrient matter by the absorbent
vessel. The absorbents are thus the architects of
the system; and the capillaries are both chemists
which form the rough material employed in the
structure, and masons which deposit and arrange it.
The conjoint action of both sets of vessels is necessary
to the formation of the simplest tissue; and
it is by their united labour that the compound
organs are built up out of the simple tissues.</p>

<p><a id="para_988"></a>988. It is conjectured that the immediate living
agents by which this vital attraction is exerted
between the blood and the tissues are the organic
nerves. These nerves consist of two sets, those
which enter as constituents into the tissues and
those which accompany the capillaries. It has
been shown (304), that while the membranous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
tunics of the capillaries diminish, the nervous
filaments distributed to them increase; that the
smaller and thinner the capillaries the greater the
proportionate quantity of their nervous matter; and
that this is most remarkably the case in organs of
the greatest irritability. It is conceived that the
capillaries, in consequence of the nervous structure
which thus envelops them, exert upon the fluid
which is flowing through them an influence perfectly
analogous to that of the secreting organ, in
consequence of which similar particles are abstracted
from the blood as those which compose the
tissue in which the operation takes place.</p>

<p><a id="para_989"></a>989. It is further conjectured that the physical
agent by which this action upon the blood is effected
is the galvanic fluid. Dutrochet believes that he
has actually formed muscular fibre from albumen
by galvanism. He considers the red particles of
the blood as pairs of electrical plates, and thinks
that the nucleus is electronegative, and the capsule
electropositive. Müller has repeated and critically
examined the interesting experiments of Dutrochet;
and while he arrives in many essential points at
different results, expresses the highest admiration
of the ingenious manner in which this philosopher
has sought to solve a great problem. “If,” says
Müller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span> “a drop of an aqueous solution of the yolk
of egg (in which very small microscopic globules
are suspended) be galvanised, the currents discovered
by Dutrochet will be observed. The wave,
proceeding from the copper or negative pole, in
which the alkali of the decomposed salt accumulates,
is transparent, from the solution of albumen
by the alkali. The wave, proceeding from
the positive or zinc pole, particularly in its circumference,
is opaque, and white from the acid it contains.
Both waves encounter, and exactly in the
line of contact a linear coagulum is immediately
produced, which assumes the form of the line of
contact, and is curled at times as the edges of the
waves are meeting. The meeting of both waves
takes place with a lively motion, in the line of contact,
when the deposition of coagulum takes place;
but as soon as the deposition of coagulum has
occurred, all is tranquil, and not the least trace of
motion is observed. It is therefore inconceivable
how an observer of the first rank, like Dutrochet,
can pronounce this coagulated albumen contractile
muscular fibre, generated by galvanism; it is
nothing but coagulated albumen. This coagulum,
besides, like the albumen which is deposited by
galvanism round the zinc pole, has no consistence,
but is composed of globules easily separated by
stirring, and only precipitated in the line where
the two waves meet without cohesion.”</p>

<p><a id="para_990"></a>990. But though science has not yet succeeded
in ascertaining with certainty the physical agency
to which the ultimate changes that take place in
organized matter are to be referred, there cannot be
a question that they are dependent on physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
agents; and the legitimate object of scientific
inquiry is to discover what those agents are, and to
ascertain the modifications they undergo by those
vital affinities to the influence of which they are
subjected.</p>

<p><a id="para_991"></a>991. The discoveries which science has already
made relative to the influence of certain physical
agents on particular organs, and to the influence of
the whole circle of physical agents on the whole
living economy, have added not a little to human
power over human health and disease. But these
agents also exert an influence scarcely less momentous
on the entire apparatus and action of the
animal life, so inseparably linked with the organic.
An account will therefore be next given of the
structure and function of the nervous and muscular
systems. The exposition of these systems, which
will be as brief as possible, will be followed by a
full account of the action of physical agents on the
whole of this complex and wonderful organization.
The detail of the ascertained phenomena will have
a strict reference to the development of the physical
and mental powers of the human being, and thereby
a close and practical application will be attempted
of physiology to the production and preservation of
health.</p>

It is not a perfectly accurate statement that the
temperature of venous and arterial blood is precisely the
same. The latest and best experiments concur in showing
that arterial blood, at least in the heart and the great
arterial trunks, is one or two degrees warmer than venous
blood. The weight of evidence from experiment is also in
favour of the opinion, that the different parts of the body
are <em>somewhat</em> less warm as they recede from the lungs and
heart; but the difference is so slight that it may be disregarded

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
